FRANCE.  (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) PARIS, WEDNESDAY EVENING,  M. Baudin, whose nomination as Charge d'Affaires at St. Petersburg was announced to you some days back, has this day left for his post. Count de Rayneval, the French Ambassador at Rome, has this day arrived here to confer with his government on the lamentable position of affairs in the Papal States. Apropos of Rome, I read in a Marseilles paper that the Pope is about to proclaim an amnesty, and to adopt some important reforms. The responsibility of this assertion I must, however, leave to your cotemporary.  The session of the Legislative Body has been brought to a close this day. The Princes of the Orleans family have, I am informed, written to their friends in this city to complain bitterly of the Duchess d'Orleans, their sister•in-law, for having made her son the Count de Paris write a letter repudiating the fusion of their political cause with that of the Count de Chambord.  The fine weather we have had recently appears to have done an immensity of good to the crops, and the government, I am told, has ascertained that if it only continue a reasonable time, the harvest will be above the usual average, so that the damage done by the inundations will not be so severely felt.  The Boitrse has been better to-day, the Threes having risen 60e. for time and 50e. for cash on the closing prices of yesterday, and most other securities having progressed in proportion. The cause is that the monthly settlement went off, on the whole, better than had been expected, that the Bank of France will, most likely, to-morrow reduce its discount to 4-t per cent., and that the telegraphs announce a rise in the funds at London.  On Monday I told you that M. Fould and Marshal Vaillant were to replace the Ministers of Finance and Public Instruction during their absence. To-day the Moniteur announces that yesterday the Emperor signed the decrees nomina• ting them. Thus, then, lam informed of what the Cabinet meant to do, a day before the arrange went was submitted to the sanction and signature of the Emperor ! The King of the Belgians has given £BOO to the victims of the inundations.  The Moniteur says that the Emperor, on arriving at Nancy last evening on his way to Plombieres, was received with enthusiasm by the population, though no official reception was, given to him. It is said that conferences between Russia, France, and England, for making some definitive settlement about Greece, are about to be held in London. In addition to the disorganised state of that unfortunate country, the accession to the throne is an object of difficulty. Prince Adalbert, of Bavaria, the present king's brother, who was designated as his successor, being reluctant to embrace the Greek religion, which the Greeks insist on, some other prince will have to be chosen. In case the state of Greece should, as is expected, continue to require military intervention, it is intended, I hear, to cause the intervention to be made by Russia, France, and England, jointly, wherever practicable. The King of Greece, who is at present at Vienna, is expected here in September, on his return to his own country; but, notwithstanding assertions to the contrary, made in some continental papers, it is not likely, I am told, that he will visit England—he hates our country too much.  AMERICAN MAILS.—The Niagara sails to-morrow morning for Boston with the mails. The box at the Liverpool postoffice closes at nine o'clock, but with late fees letters will be received until ten o'clock, and on the landing.stage until eleven o'clock.

Hugh M'Neile, D D., by 239 of the workmen employed at Messrs Milner's Phcenix Iron Safe Works, the rev. divine has consented to preach in the open air on Sunday next the 6th instant, at Windsor, in the immediate vicinity of the Works. .  THE HEALTH OF THE TOWNSHIP OP SEA.COMBE.At the meeting of the Wallasey Local Board of Health, held last night, Mr. Odell drew the attention of its members to the fact that there was at the present time seventeen persons, married and single, all living in one house, which the inspector of nuisances had not reported. FlRE.—Yesterday evening, about six o'clock, an alarm was given of a fire having broken out in a cotton kiln, belonging to Mr. Gaskell, and situate in Fleet-street. The engine of the West of England, ani Mr. Hewett and the fire brigade, were quickly on the spot, and by dint of great exertions succeeded in extinguishing the fire, which at first had an alarming aspect. The extent of the damage consequent upon the conflagration is estimated at about £2OO. We have not heard the cause to which the outbreak is attributed.  ART TREASURES EXHIBITION, 1857.—0 n Wednesday a deputation from the executive committee had the honour of an interview with his Royal Highness Prince Albert, at Buckingham Palace. Mr. Thomas Fairbairn, the chairman, explained to the prince the details of the approved design for the exhibition building. Lord Overstone, a member of the general council, was also present, es were the Mayor of Manchester, Mr. Entwisle, Mr. Stern, Mr. Heron, and Mr. John C. Deane, the general commissioner. His royal highness, in the course- of a lengthened interview, made some valuable suggestions to the deputation, and expressed his cordial approval of the project, which has now assumed a national importance.  Tits WORKING CLAssys.—The Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes had its anniversary meeting on Monday, at the Freemason's Tavern, under the presidency of the Earl of Shaftesbury, The committee, according to the report, in their recent en• deavours to make fit for human dwellings the houses in the courts, lanes, and alleys of London, had been making experiments in Wild court, Drury-lane ; Clark's-buildings, St. Giles's ; and Tyndall's-buildings, Gray's-innlane, which they had so thoroughly cleansed and purified that only 13 deaths in the year had occurred in 195 families and 1,417 people. The society's receipts from December, 1854, to December, 1855, had been £10,821 19s 6d, of which there wgs remaining a balance of £666 12s Bd. Model lodging houses have been, or are about to be, erected in Paris, on the Boulevard Mazas ; in Boston, Unite] States ; in Hobart Town, Tasmania ; and in Gottenburg, Sweden ; while similar societies have lately been formed in Marylebone, Hampstead, Worcester, Norwich, Lambeth, and Bath, and there is every probability of the long contemplated labourers' houses in the city being constructed before the termination of another twelve months.  IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.  HOUSE OF LORDS.—THIIRSDAY. Their Lordships met this afternoon at, five o'clock. REFOIIMATORY, &O , SCIIOOLS.  The Reformatory and Industrial Schools Bill was read a third time.

Their Lordships adjourned at half-past eight o'clock.  HOUSE OF COMMONS.—THURSDAY The SPEAKER took the chair at twelve o'clock. PETITIONS.  Mr. G. M. BUTT presented a petition from the medical officers of various unions in Leicestershire, compla,ning of their grievances. A large number of peti ions to the same effect were presented from different parts of the country. Sir G. PECRELL presented petitions from Gosport, Aylesbury, and other places, against the Poor Law Amendment Bill.  POOR LAW AMENDMENT (NO. 2)_BILL,  On the motion for the second reading of this bill, Sir G. PECFIELL opposed the bill. He had hoped the contention and strife on this subject had ceased with the discussions of 1844 and 1845. The bill had been brought in without notice, and attempts made to read it a second time at unreasonable hours, but the measure was so unpalatable to the House, that eventually it had to he withdrawn, and reintroduced in an amended form. Ho objected to the compulsory clauses repealing the 22nd Geo. 11., and abolishing the Gilbert unions. There was also another objectionable proviiion which limited the publicity of the rules and orders of the Poor Law Board, and confined them to the clerks of the peace, instead of their being sent to the clerks of petty sessions. The bill also provided that each parish should keep a fire engine, a somewhat odd provision to introduce into a measure for the relief of the poor, while it contained many other objectionable provisions, such as those relating to the chargeability of wayfares, and the creation of new auditorships, which removed the appointment from the guardians to the Poor Law Board, and placed the accounts for watching and lighting in parishes under these poor law auditors. The hon. and gallant member, who went at great length into the details of the bill, concluded by moving, as an amendment, that it be read a second time upon this day six months.  Lord GALWAY seconded the amendment, and appealel to the Vice-President of the Poor Law Board to withdraw the measure for the session.  Mr. BOUVERIE contended that extra parochial places should come under the Poor Law Act, and asked the House to allow him to pass so much of the measure as. carried out that object. Sir JOAN TROLLOPE approved of such a limitation of the scope of the measure. A conversation followed which continued till tele minutes to four o'clock, when, in accordance with the. standing, orders, the debate was adjourned. The sitting was then suspended. At six o'clock the House resumed its sitting. THE EAST INDIA. DIRECTORS' DONATION.  In reply to Mr. OTWAY, Mr. V. SMITH stated that the sum contributed by the East India Company for the relief of th, sufferers by the inundations in France would be charged on the revenue, subject to the sanction of the Board of Control. The board were at liberty to expend any sum short of 4'600, without the consent of Parliament.  THE ROYAL MILITARY COLEGES  On the motion for going into committee of supply, Mr. PEEL, in answer to Mr. Rim!, said that the sum of £75 each, voted for the education of sons of civilians at the Royal Military College, was for three-quarters of a year, and the annual cost, therefore, was not as had been inferred £75, but £lOO.  RULES OF ARMY PROMOTION.  In answer to Captain VERNON,  Mr. PEEL said there was no rule by which a subaltern, when he became captain, should be rewarded by a step of brevet rank, and this was the case as regarded the line as well as the scientific corps.  THE AMERICAN MINISTER.  In answer to Mr. BAILLIE,  Lord PALMERSTON said, that Mr. Dallas had power to negotiate with her Majesty's Government for the settlement of the Central American question, which the, Government had been led to believe was not possessed by Mr. Buchanan.  After some further discussion, the House went into committee of  SUPPLY  The remaining civil service estimates and the militia estimates, which conclude the votes of supply for the year, were agreed to.  WILLS, &C., BILL  The motion for going into committee on the Wills and Administration Bill gave rise to some discussion, which resulted in:the postponement of the committee till Tuesday next. calTaca BUILDING COMMISSION BILL. The motion for going into committee ou the Church Building Commission Bill,  Mr. 14ADFIELD opposed the motion, and expressed his' intention to take the sense of the House upon it. On a division, the numbers appeared— For going into committee 159 Against it.  Majority .. 150 The bill then went through committee. The Militia Ballots Suspension Bill also went through. committee.  The Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment (No. 2) Bill, and the Turnpike Acts Continuance Bill, were read a third time and passed.  The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and the House adjourned at one o'clock.  Forty Greek pirates is said to have seized a government vessel near the Island of Seaphos.

The conclusion of the decree is as follows :—"" We are of and henry Thohy opinion that when Mr. Dyce Sombre executed this will, and when he executed the codicil, he was of unsound mind, and, consequently, that the acts so done by hint were null and void ; therefore we advise her Majesty to. affirm the judgment of the learned judge of the Prerogative Court, pronouncing against the validity of theso instruments. There remains, however, another question, of great importance with respect to the costs of the suit. We have decided humbly to advise her Majesty to vary, the decree below with respect to costs; to give no costs. against the appellants, but to allow them out of the estato• one set of costs only between Mr. Priusep and the Els'.

The prizes to professional modellers were awarded to Miss Newton, and to amateurs to Miss Lawton. The specimens were most delighful to look upon, and showed the perfection to which those ladies had brought the beautiful art.  At two o'clock the Gardens presented a very gay and enchanting scene. Thousands of visitors in the richest and gayest attire crowded into the marquee, to inspect the beauties of nature. Before four o'clock not less than four thousand ladies and gentlemen of the town and neighbourhood visited this delightful scene, all of whom departed expressing the highest encomiums upon the delightful treat provided for them. The day's enjoyment was much enhanced by the music discoursed by two splendid bands, who played a variety of the most popular airs of the day. Shortly after four o'clock the doors were thrown open to the middle classes, when an immense number of persons availed themselves of the opportunity afforded them of viewing the magnificent display.

The unfortunate deceased is a woman named Elizabeth Mil'ward, and the prisoner is a man named John Phipson. It appears that the prisoner and the deceased, with the deceased's illegitimate daughter, a girl of 18, and a young woman named Mary Ann Phipson, niece to the prisoner, were at work together making nails. The deceased had been in the practice of keeping a jug of water in the workshop, for the use of herself and her daughter, and the prisoner had frequently, to her great annoyance, appropriated the water to his own use. This had occasioned frequent quarrels between them. On Friday afternoon, the prisoner's neice having handed the water jug to her uncle, he drank its contents, on which the deceased threw a handful of coal dust and ashes in his face. On this the prisoner drew a piece of red hot iron, about two feet in length and pointed at the extremity, from the forge, and either threw or thrust it at the deceased with great force, so that it entered her side to a depth of four inches, and burning its way, dropped out again upon the ground. The deceased fell, and being carried home, died immediately afterwards. The evidence of Eliza Millward, the deceased's daughter, and of Mary Ann Phipson, the prisoner's niece, corroborated the above statement of facts. Mr. Harding, surgeon, describ d the nature of the wound, which was between the ninth and tenth ribs on the left side, passing towards the spine. The magistrate committed the prisoner for wilful murder, and he will be tried at the ensuing assizes, which commence at Worcester on the 12th  PARIS, Thursday.— The Emperor arrived at five o'clock yesterday evening, at Plombieres.

BERLIN, June 29.—Count de Hatzfeld, Prussian Miaister at Paris, has informed the Prussian Government, that his Majesty Napoleon 111. has invited the Emperor of Austria to an interview at the chateau of A renemberg. The invitation has beerraccepted. It is stated in Paris, that the affairs of Greece are about to be discussed at a conference in London, at which Lord Clarendon, and the representatives of France and Russia, will settle various questions arising about the state of Greece. A Belgian journal states, that the succession to the throne of Greece is one of the points to be settled.  THE BURWELL STAKES.--Monday next, the 7th inst., is appointed to try the action, Pedley v. Lord John Scott, at Guildhall, for the recovery of these stakes paid to his Lordship by Mr. Weathert y under the decision of the Stewards of the Jockey Club. Should the plaintiff be successful, it will in no way affect the bets, as Cannobie was adjudged to be the winner by the only recognised racing, tribunal. The trial will, however, create the liveliest interest in all the metropolitan and provincial sporting circles.  ESCAPE OF CARDINAL PATRIZI.— A letter recently received from Genoa narrates the following:—The Vicar of Rome, Monsigaore Patrizi, on his transit from "" the Eternal City' to Civita Vecchia, only escaped from falling into the clutches of Lazzarini by that celebrated brigand's arriving too late at the point where his ambuscade was to be planted. But for this contretemps, his band was sufficiently numerous to have overpowered the guards of the Legate Lazzarini had promised his wife the consecrated golden rose destined for the Empress of the French, for herself; and the reliquary with the straw from the cradle of Bethlem, to hang at the neck of their child.

MANSFIELD) STABBING BY A MAN OF COLOUR.--A coloured seaman, named James Stones, boatswain of the North American, now lying in the Wellington Dock, was placed at the bar, charged with stabbing one of his messmates named Charles Thomas. It appeared that the crew had not long been at work on Thursday morning, when a dispute took place between the prisoner and another of the men. The cornptainant interfered, observing that the other man was no match for the prisoner. Thereupon the prisoner drew his knife and stabbed the complainant near the shoulder. The wound, fortunately, was not of a dangerous character. lie was ordered to pay a fine of £5, or in default, two months' impr;sonment.  2%tuoGLlNG.—Alexander Wilson, master of the ship James Lumsien, was fined £3 13s, for attempting to smuggle a quantity of cigars and tobacco.  (BEFORE ME. F. A. HAMILTON.) EMBEZZLEMENT.--A man named John Davis, who was employed by Mr. Charles Every, tailor, 21, Basnett-street, as collector, was charged by him with embezzling the sum of £2 10s. It appeared that he had received the money, being the amount of an account, from Mr. Jones, clothier, of Scotland-road, and, not making any return of it, the account was again sent in to Mr. Jones, The prison( r admitted having received the money, and that, having by some mischance lost it, he was unwilling to mention the circumstance to his employer. Mr. Every said he believed it was the first offence committed by the prisoner, and that he was, therefore, unwilling to press bard upon him, He was remanded for seven days for punishment.  A TASTE FOR PAINTINGS.--A woman—named Sarah Parker, who carried a fine child in her arms, was charged with stealing an oil-painting from Wesibrook's publichouse, Ch 104-street, on Wednesday. It appeared that the prisoner was waiting, on the day in question, for a considerable time in the house, to receive, as she said, from a shipping maser named Parker, a weekly allowance for her child, and that, when she was coming down stairs, the painting fell from her clothes, She was committed for a month.  CHARGE OF BIGAMY AGAINST A SAILOR.—John Leah, a sailer, was brought up on remand, charged with bigamy. He was married on the 13th of May, 1851, at Davinhana church Cheshire, to Ann Robinson ; but, unhappily, she was not long true to her vow of constancy, for, on the day after the marriage she deserted his bed and board, and only returned in a short time to rob him of his clothes Under those circumstances the prisoner thought he might lawfull7 again try his luck in the lottery, and he drew Rosanna Humphreys, to whom he was married in Liverpool a short time since. He was defended by Mr. Black. The magistrate considered that no jury would convict in the case, and accordingly discharged the prisoner.  The Bank of England made no alteration in the rate of discount at yesterday's meeting. A public meeting of the inhabitants of Montrose was held on Wednesday for theliereetion of a monument to Joseph flume in his native town, representedsby him in Parliament for twenty-five years.

Divines of the Gaussen and Bickersteth school have done all they could to ruin the cause of the Bible, and to imperil the very existence of Christianity. yheir motto has been—all or none. Every word in the Bible is abso. lute truth, or it is utterly worthless as an authority : a Revelation is not to be questioned in any of its parts, and in the case of an infallible writing, even contradictions must be accepted as equally true. When the alternatives have been so sharply stated, there has seemed a necessity. either of abdicating the functions of the reason which God has given to man,, or of abandoning altogether, as deceptive and misleading. the "" Book of books."" Yet it has; undoubtedly informed and guided many generations for good ; around it cling, with almost all of us, many tender memories ; it has searched the very inward life of many heart s,—has aroused many noble purposes,—has supported the feeble under many sorrows; and concerning it there lingers, even when the coldest and most critical of those who have been brought up in a land where it is worshipped, many amiable prejudices, if not heartfelt and deep impressions of respect. When geologians, astronomers, and natural historians, have made assaults on the infallibility of the Mosaic record of the Creation, of the Noachian deluge, of the ass speaking with man's voice, of the sign on the sun dial of Ahaz—when chronologers have animadverted on contra. dictory and impossible periods, and other observers have pointed out internal discrepancies in Old Testament histories and in the account of Evangelists, the maintainers of plenary inspiration have been able only to reply with their alternative. But another school of considerable pretension to acumen has come to the rescue. Sophists, rather than divines, they have chuckled over a verbal distinction, and have thought that they had found in it the solution of a grave theological question. Archbishop Whately, * * * * discovered that the Scriptures were not intended to deliver geological, astronomical, or any other scientific truth, they might even on such subjects declare errpr ; but they were intendel to teach religious truth, and in that department their revelations are to be received as infallible. The insufficiency of this solution has been felt by all minds but those which mistake puzzle for satisfaction ; for the range of the religious teaching of the Bible is not thereby defined, nor can it he distinctly parted off from the conterminous regions of morals and of mundane facts. Especially if the religious teaching of the Bible include its morality, it is here that it is most inconsistent with itself. And with respect to its declarations concerning things presumed to lie beyond human sight and experience, little reliance can be placed upon statements incapable of verification on the part of witnesses, who, where their testimony can be checked, are found ignorant, defective, simple, prejudiced, and inconsistent. Meanwhile, biblical criticism has been continually sharpening the point of the objections to any theory of infallible inspiration of Scripture ; and, what is more, they have been laid before the popular understanding in an intelligible form. The discussion of scriptural difficulties is not now an exercitation exclusively for scholars; and the reconcilement. if it be possible, of the errors to be met with in the Bible with a just and reverent estimation of it, is a problem in which multitudes of thoughtful lay—people, and not a few ministers only, now feel the deepest interest. To the solution of this problem, the Rev. John Maenaught,* a clergyman beneficed in the established church, addresses himself, in a work distinguished by a fearless investigation of truth, an uncompromising hostility to deception and make-believe, a sincere worship of all which is holy and good—distinguished likewise by clearness of conception, closeness of argument, purity of expression, and completeness of arrangement. And unless intolerance and superstition shall succeed in smothering the work which we proceed further to notice, it is one which will exercise a wide influence, one which will give form and substance to thoughts which have been floating vaguely in many men's minds ; one which will supply a rallying point, and become in lieu of a creed to those who are dissatisfied with traditional and untenable theories respecting inspiration. ""The object of this Essay is to be destructive of prevailing errors ; to be constructive of a true doctrine of inspiration; to uphold the highest reasonab e authority for Holy Writ ; and to give ease and security in Christian faith, to all piously and honestly disposed mincs.""—Preface.  In the outset of the "" destructive "" part of his undertaking, that is, the pulling down the theory of the infallible inspiration of Scripture, Mr. Macnaught premise.:, that although fallibility admits of degrees, infallibility admits of none, and a few well-chosen examples of inaccuracies and discrepancies will be sufficient to destroy the dogma of the infallibility of Scripture. These examples the author prefers to select from the well-known pages of the New Testament, and rather from the class of evident internal contradictions, than from scientific objections. He does not open any unnecessary questions respecting the probable authorship of the four gospels, but contents himself with pointing out the impossibility of reconciling, under any hypothesis of absolute truth, the conflicting genealogies of Matthew and Luke, the conflicting accounts oftthe residence of the holy family, the impracticability of interpolating the flight into Egypt into the rest of the history, the occurrence of misquotation from the Old Testament, as when ""Jeremy the prophet "" is substituted for Zechariah (Matt. xxvii. 9). Hundreds of other instances, indeed, might have been adduced, and the details have been more forcibly pressed, than even our author has pressed them, and,  • "" In vast numbers of cases, alternative questions may be proposed.—Did 23,10) die in the plague, or was it 24 000? Was the Saviour crucified t nine in the morn ng, or was he still on trial at mid-d ty ? Did Judas buy the Acsldama, or were the chief pries's its purchasers ? Did the cock crow once before Peter's two last denials, and is Mark right, or did the e,ck not crow at all till af•er Peter's three denials, and is Maik wrong? Alternative questions may thus be readily framed by the score ; and whichever alternative the reader accepts, the Bible alike denies Its own infallibility. In nil such alternative questions, the conviction on near mind is, that one or other of the inspired penmen was, in each case, mistaken; and, on whichever side tha error may have been, the supposed infallibility of the Bible is equally disproved.""—p. 52. There are expedients, indeed, by which it is endeavoured to reconcile differences, and to explain away apparent error; but  ""For ourselves, we have endured too much bitter anguish in this to doubt that the tins itisfrictory apologies of well-meaning Christians, whose wish it is to defend what they suppose to he 'the faith,' ha e repelled many an anxious inquirer, and driven many an earnest heart into the bleak inhospitalities of unbelief. Hut truth is v rily great; and although the popular mind—alike of believers on the one side, and of unbelievers on the other—is still far removed from logical and true views on the grand subject of inspiration, yet there has been progress in the right direction.""—p. 53.  Then we come to the admissions of some modern then. logians, and to the palliative suggested by Whately and others, upon which it is observed— "" The 'learned few' may he able to perceive the ni a distinctions between the religious, and therefore infallible sections of the as contrasted with its non-religious, and therefore fallible sect ons or meanings; but the unlearned many will ture4 not be able to perceive distinctly these shades of difference.  —„. "" If, on the ground of the,e recogni.ed and palpable errors in the science, history, and morality of Scripture. our bishops had said clearly and intelligibly, that the Bible was, however excellent, yet a fallible hook, we should have admired their clearsightedness and their courage even more so than we now do; but, as it is, our ecclesiastical rulers seem to confess a great part of ;he truth, and then to stop short, and suddenly uphold the idea of religious infallibility in a fallible b00k.... For ourselves, we, as part of the unlearned many, are ready to exclaim—Oh ! enviable logical perception, never to c refound morality with religion ! and never to doubt the mysteries of the faith, whi st all the narratives of facts on which those mysteries are based, are avowedly open to criticism and die. belief.""—pp. 64-5.  As an instance, among others, of error in the Bible, even in matters of religion, may be alleged the contradiction between the Old and New Testaments on the subject of Immortality and a Resurrection. The passages from the Psalms, and from Job, which have been held by some to point to a resurrection, are acknowledged by scholars to have reference to the Divine interposition in this life; whereas the despairing expressions in such places as Ps. vi. 5, and Ps. lxxxviii. 10-12, ""if they had been found in Aristotle, instead of in the Hagiographa,"" would have been taken as indubitable denials of the immortality of the soul. The conduct of Hezekiah, under the immediate prospect of death, together with the subsequent description of what his feelings had been, while ho esteemed it imminent, further show unmistakeably, that dissolution was regarded by the most pious of the Hebrews, before the era of the Captivity, as the end of man, On the other hand—  ""It is quite need'ess to prove. by quotation that the New Testamint scriptures con radict these sombre vi .1% sof death ; they con, fessedly teach the immortality of the s ul. and the resurrectiol of a glorified, spirittial body. Both these doctrines cannot be true. Either the despairing doctrine of annihilation must be true, arid the hopeful thought of a better world wrong; or the doctrine of immortality must be true. and the thought of annihilation false. Wh,chever alternative is chosen. Vie not on of the Bible beine an lufalllble teacher, even of religion, is alike contravened by Scripture Itself.""1). 73.  By such examples we are brought, at the close of the first book of the work, to the conclusion that, whatever else may be the proper meaning of inspiration, as applied to the scriptures, it cannot, consistently with facts, mean suggestion of infallible teaching, either with respect to science, history, morality, or religion. In the ensuinc, book are reviewed the reasons which may be alleged for expecting an inspirational infallibility in the Bible; the circular nature of the argument from miracles is pointed out, and the inference from the prophetic inspiration is turned aside by the reflection that, on the evidence or Scripture itself, the prophetic afflatus was occasional, not constant. There are, elsewhere, some exceedingly acute observations on the conditional character of the Scripture prophecies. Then follows an examination of canonical authority, and of the vouchers for the infallibility of the Old Testament, which are presumed to be found in the New. We must be pardoned for another extract from the conclusion of the second book. "" We have seen that the authority sad to be attributed to Scripture I,y Jesus, cannot be understood as implying the infallibility of Holy Writ; and that, if it cou'd, we s""ould still need some proot, that we had an infallible record of what Jesus bad said. "" We have seen that the amazing excellence of the Bible no more p oyes it infallible, than similar excellence proves anytbinz else, In which that excellence resid:s, to be tree from all error and imperfection.  the 11,story of the Can.prcving `° We have seen, that instead cf the Bible infallible, that history itself needs no investization. if indeed it be not hopelessly da k ; so that it is rather the goodness and approved excellence of the Oli and New Testaments which which warranasst oures us of their ito t 9 heirspiratai con.nonicity, than their canonicity promises of inspiration ` We have seen that our Lord's several may b •—if indeed we should not say must be—so Interpreted a wholly to exude the element of infallibility from the idea of in spiration. .. • . .•... And, yet avain, we have seen that there is nothing in the idea ofinspiration itse'f which renders it incompatible for errors to exist In a person or in a book in which a measure of the Spirit of God is i ;dwelling..... "" We have for ourselves at le,st exercised the ghost of infallibility from the 13,b'e ; but is that volume therefore become profitless in our eyes? Far otherwise. We value it, not bee ruse of the spurious tinsel with which men had surrounded it, but for the real and genuine gold which the Heavenly Father has placed therein. "" If we revere and study all the so-called uninspir,d books which we de,m wise and good, though fallible, why because we have abandoned an untenable and unreasonable notion of its infallibility,  * ""The Doctrine of Inspiration: being sn Enquiry concerning the Infallibility, Inspiration, and Authority of Holy Writ.' By the Rev. John Macnaucht, M.A., Oxon, Incumbent of St. Chrysostom's Church Evertonp Liverpool. London: Longman And Co. 1856,  should we lose one jot of veneration for that best and holiest book, the Bible, to which many, if not all, of the greatest and wisest men in modern times at least, have agreed in affixing the glorious epithet ' inspired ? '""7pp. 164, ff.  Excellently well —wror;ght out is the definition of ""inspiration."" elicited from the scriptural usage of terms cognate with it, and from the application of it in Christian literature. The definition itself is given as, that action of the Divine Spirit by which, apart from any idea of infallibility, all that is good in man, beast, or matter, is originated and sustained.—p. 196. The proper authority of Scripture is then examined, and the maxim of St. Paul, "" prove all things • hold fast that which is good,"" is shown to be applicable to Holy Writ itself, inasmuch as it is a mixed material. ' In the concluding part of his work, Mr. Macnaught has thought it advisable to provide against some objections to his theory, which may be drawn from its supposed dogmatical and ecclesiastical consequences. Very few professional divines have the courage to accept the truth, until they have cautiouslyascertained that the corollaries derivable from it will involve nothing dangerous to their system, or their position. Perhaps, therefore, Mr. Macnaught has acted wisely in endeavouring to anticipate the difficulties which may arise to him from certain quarters. Nevertheless, in so doing he seems to have proceeded rather upon the suggestions of friends, than upon his own unbiassed judgment ; and the execution of this portion, with respect to the influence of his view of inspiration on existing dogmatical systems, is ;not alto.. gether successful. We cannot think that Book v. Chap. 1, sec. 2, will be esteemed satisfactory by those whom it is intended to conciliate. There are many who would willingly goad Mr. Macnaught into a profession of belief in order to entangle him in the formularies of the Church to which he belongs ; but there is no authority, ecclesiastical or civil, in this realm, whose questions, as to his internal faith, a person in Mr. Macnaught's position is bound to answer. There are tribunals before which the writings of ecclesiastics may be tried, and * * but he is not obliged to accept or to deny for himself other men's inferences. Meanwhile, we observe with satisfaction that there is a growing band of liberal theologians in the English Church—Milman, Hampden, Wilson, Jowett, Williams, Macnaught, of whom the last has spoken more clearly and boldly than any who have preceded him. It is natural that such men should be bound by many ties of affection to the communion in which they have been brought up; that they should be unwilling to surrender official positions; that they should hope, by remaining where they are, to exercise an effectual influence in the cause of truth, and to liberalise a great national institution. Whether or not there is a likelihood that such hopes can be realised, we are not prepared to discuss. But from whatever quarter the movement towards it originates, by whatever influences it is advanced, there is no exaveration in saying that the clear renunciation of the doctrine of the inspirational infallibility of Scrip- , ture will have consequences, not upon a single Church, but upon Christianity at large, as important as the Protestant denial of the infallibility of the Pope. Creeds can at most remain only as probable statements, when it shall be distinctly apprehended that biblical authority does not imply absolute truth; and articles may, without difficulty, be accepted as "" agreeable to the Word of God "" —that is, to the Bible—as fair exponents of it, although confessed to contain, as that does, truth and error in every possible relative admixture. When it shall be acknowledged that those, like this, mingled together closely, if not undistinguishably—self-evident axioms with unfounded hypotheses, certitudes with probabilities, plain propositions with allegories, metaphors, and ambiguities, —they will wither, dry up, and be cast aside as useless; churches will cease to quarrel about that s hioh they no longer regard as indubitably true ; and Christianity will be enabled, thenceforward, unencumbered, to make its final essay upon the evil of the world, as a moral power. We should recommend those who still think that they can maintain the position of the infallibility of Scripture, to obtain, if they can, a little book published at San Francisco, entitled ""The Evidences against Christianity.""' Scriptural discrepancies, contradictions, and difficulties collected from various sources are therein very cleverly put together. But the result is not evidence against Christianity, unless the defenders of Christianity are content that it should stand or fall with the truth of the letter of the Bible in all its parts. If the accounts are correct which roach this country concerning the state of society in California, we fear that the publication of this little book, unaccompanied with any moral warning, may be productive of immediate evil. An attempt should at least have been made to place the moral obligations of man on a firm basis ; and gold seekers, gamblers, and ruffians might have been reminded that, more than any scriptural declarations, they themselves render probable the coming of a retribution in the world to come, for it would not be conceivable that such as they should not ultimately, here or hereafter, receive their deserts.  * "" The Evidences against Christianity.""

His Royal Highness arrived at the Palace of Westminster at three o'clock, attended by Colonel F. H. Seymour. The meeting broke up at a quarter past six o'clock. The Queen, accompanied by the Princess Royal and the Princess Charlotte of Belgium, and attended by the Hon. Flora Macdonald, took a drive in an open landau and four on Wednesday afternoon. The Countess de Neuilly, the Duke and Duchess de Nemours, the Prince and Princess de Joinville, and the Duke and Duchess d'Aumale, visited the King of the Belgians at Buckingham Palace. The King of the 'Belgians visited the Duchess of Kent at Clarence-house, St. James's. His Majesty, accompanied by the Princess Charlotte of Belgium and the Count of Flanders, paid visits to the Duchess of Gloucester and the Duchess of Cambridge in the afternoon, at their respective residences. Her Majesty, on Wednesday night, gave a state concert at Buckingham Palace, and, for the first time, in the new ball and concert room, a spacious orchestra, rising from the floor to the organ gallery, having been built for the orchestra. A party of near 500 were invited, comprising the Royal Family, the Foreign Ambassadors, Ministers, and Charges d'Affaires, and a  large party of the nobility. Her Majesty and the Prince Consort, with the Princess Royal, accompanied by the King of the Belgians, the Princess Charlotte of Belgium, the Count of Flanders, the Duchess of Kent, Prince Oscar of Sweden, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Princess Mary, and the Duke of Cambridge, entered the ball and concert room about ten o'clock. The Queen wore a dress of white silk, with three flounces brocaded in roses and gold, trimmed with gold blonde. The jewels worn by her Majesty on her head consisted of opals and diamonds. The Duchess of Kent wore a dress of white brocaded silk trimmed with blonde. Her Royal Highness's head dress was formed of gold blonde, with ornaments of amethysts and diamonds and ostrich feathers. The Duchess of Cambridge wore a dress of white glace silk with three skirts richly embroidered with white bugles and chenille' each skirt edged with chenille fringe. The necklace and stomacher of diamonds and emeralds. Her Royal Highness wore a tiara of pearls and diamonds with lilac feathers. The Princess Mary of Cambridge wore a double skirt white tulle dress, with reversed bouillonnes from top to bottom, over a rich glace white silk petticoat, trimmed with bows and loops of pink ribbon, the body ornamented with blonde and pink bows, each bow having a diamond star in the centre. The necklace was diamonds. The Princess wore round her head a wreath of pink and white moss rosebuds, with diamond stars intermingled. The Princess Royal wore a dress of white crepe lisse over a petticoat of white silk, trimmed with bows of satin ribbon. The head dress was composed of pink roses. The general company followed her Majesty and the royal party into the ball and concert room. The gentlemen appeared in full dress, and the members of orders of knighthood wore their respective insignia. Directly after the entrance of the Queen the concert commenced. The orchestra, of nearly 120 performers, comprised her Majesty's private band, with several of the leading instrumentalists from the Philharmonic Society, the Royal Italian Opera, and her Majesty's Theatre. uThe chorus of sixty voices was selected from the Royal Italian Opera, the ladies of the Royal Academy of Music, and the Sacred Harmonic Society. The orchestra was conducted by Mr. Anderson director of her Majesty's private band ; Mr. W. G. dusins, the organist of her Majesty's private chapel, presiding at the organ.  ARMY PROMOTIONS.—Major-General Sir Richard England and Major-General Sir Colin Campbell are about to be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Gcneral in the Army.  MINING COMPANY OF IRELAND.—Yesterday, at the half-yearly meeting of this company, held in Dublin, a dividend for the half-year, a the rate of ten per cent per annum,lfree of income tax, was declared.  DEATH OF THE COUNTESS OF ST. GERMAINS.—We regret to announce the death of the Countess of St Germains, which took place on Wednesday at Dover. street. Her ladyship was the daughter of the last Marquis Cornwallis by his wife, the sister of the last Duke of Gordon.  THE ENTRY OF THE GUARDS INTO LONDON.—We can positively state that, up to the present time, no definite arrangements have been made for the entry of the Guards into London. The final arrangements cannot be completed until the Scots Fusilier Guards shall have arrived at Aldershott. The ships conveying the brigade, left Gibraltar on the 24th ult., and up to the time of our going to press, they had not arrived at Portsmouth. It is expected that in about two days after their arrival at that port, will be the period fixed for their re-entry.  NEW ZEALAND.--A. despatch (from Plymouth, Wednesday, July 2nd, informs us that the William and Jane, Captain Hunter, which left Canterbury, New Zealand, on the 27th of March, is off that port, bound to London. She has on board 1,100 bales of wool, being the first cargo from Canterbury. The General Assembly was to meet on the 3rd of May. The Provincial Council was sitting at Canterbury, where the new settlement is progressing most favourably ; the wheat crops and all the cereals had been gathered, and were most abundant; the crops of potatoes had failed in consequence of the heavy rains. Flour, £3O per ton ; beef, 5d per lb ; and mutton 4d to 5d per lb, wholesale.  APPREHENSIONS OF ANOTHER KAFFIR WAR.—The South African Commercial Advertiser, of the 24th of April, gives alarming intelligence from the Cape of Good Hope. In the Council on the 23rd, messages were received from his excellency the Governor, transmitting a correspondence which had taken place between the President of the Free State and Moshesh, great chief of the Basutos, with regard to the boundary line. The President of the Free State expressed his fears that a bloody war was impending between the Free State and the Basutos. He expressed his belief that a great combination was being formed between the Kaffir chiefs against the Europeans. The President a'so stated that he was about to expel a number of Zulus who had squatted on the farms of inhabitants of the State, who were becoming very troublesome by their thefts, and who threatened to cut off all communication with Natal. The Governor informed the council that on receiving this information, and on account of the alarming rumours which had reached him from the frontier of this colony, he had sent to Mauritius], requesting the immediate assistance of one regiment of her Majesty's troops. The government of the colony has to deal with a financial difficulty, the revenue during the last two years having fallen below the expenditure of .€66,000.  FIRE AT HAIJSBIIRG'S EXTENSIVE ESTABLISHMENT.—A little before three o'clock yesterday morning, a fire was d'scovered in the jewellers' workshop attached to Mr. Hausburg's premises, in Church-street, which, at first, presented an alarming appearance, but through the activity and prompt assistance of the West of England firemen, who run their engine down by hand, it was extinguished in about half an hour, but not until considerable damage was done, but the precise amount cannot be sated. The building is insured in the West of England and Norwich Union offices, and the stock in the same, and many others. FATAL ACCIDENT.—A little boy, about fourteen years of age, whose name is at present unknown, but who, it is supposed, from an invoice found on him, was an errand boy in the employment of Mr. Britton, druggist, of the Old Hay-market, was, yesterday evening, killed in Old Hallstreet. He was drawing a handcart, and, as is the custom, was holding on by a lorry to help himself along. The lorry suddenly stopped, and be was unfortunately crushed between the two vehicles. He was at once taken to the Northern Hospital, but he almost immediately died. No blame was attributable to the driver of the lorry. ",1850

NORTHERN s TWO GUINEAS PER ANNUM.  FRIDAY, JULY 4, 1856  WHAT is to be done with the Birkenhead Docks ? This is indeed an important commercial question. To the locality in which they are situated it is  paramount to all other considerations, and to the  mercantile community at large it is almost as important. With a very slight increase to British commerce, the Mersey will require a much larger  amount of clod  accommodation than we have at  present, and Birkenhead must participate in this increased demand for docks before any other portion of the river. Her central position and other natural advantages, totally irrespective of her railway facilities, command a preference to the North shore. Small local prejudices may for a while retard the work of common sense ; but the steady growth of trrde will swamp all minor interests by its immensity. Those who have watched carefully the progress of the trade of Liverpool can see, we repeat, very clearly, that the day is not far off wheri we shall be constrained to seek shelter for shipping on the Cheshire side. But are these the matters which were brought under the notice of Parliament ? Nothing of the kind. There was a great engineer. ing—a monster professional battle to be fought. Rival dock projectors and wordy barristers their bows and speeches before a committee, and to renew a contest of which every member of the House of Commons  k, and the Birkenhead Dock Committee preferred delaying a great and necessary work to having the old story of dock making  thoroughly  all oser again. What, then, remains to be done under the cir cumstances ? The Liverpool pock Committee would not be justified in allowing Mr. HARTLEY to proceed with his plans, while there is an act in force to make the Birkenhead Trust follow out Mr. RENDEeS design. Pursuing such a course would be scarcely pardonable in the eyes of a future Parliamentary Committee, and it is not likely that it will be attempted. The Dock authorities might be secure in carrying on the work as sanctioned by the Legislature when they purchased the estate. The emergency of the case would be a sufficient answer to any objection which could be raised hereafter. But, then, what is to become of Mr. HARTLEY'S plans ? Will the committee compel Mr. HARTLEY to carry out the designs of his rival ? The whole difficulty in the way of proceeding with the completion of the Birkenhead Docks seems to rest on this one point. And it is rather too bad that while both sides of the river have their engineers, that trade is not to have the increased shipping facilities which will assuredly be required before those in question can be brought into full operation.  As for charging the Liverpool Dock Committee now with a desire to keep Birkenhead in the back ground, the idea is simply ridiculous. The rapid extension of trade has often pressed them sorely, and the screw will overtake them again ere long The space on the banks of the Mersey applicable  to docks has its limit, and when the whole of it has been brought into use, there will still be traffic enough on our northern coast to support half a dozen Liverpools. It is only a question of time as to When Birkenhead must be treated with tender solicitude—when her docks must be made, and her legitimate share of the trade of our port passed into its proper channel. This moment of auspicious compulsion is, we are inclined to think, nearer at hand than the good folk of Birkenhead, or the Dock Committee believe. Be this as it may, we cannot credit the statements made at the meeting of the Birkenhead Commissioners on Tuesday, with regard to undertaking works not sanctioned by Parliament.  The chairman who presided at the meeting stated, that he "" understood the Corporation were "" about to do all the inner works, and as much of "" the exterior works as would be applicable to any plan "" that might be hereafter adopted, and that for that  "" purpose, in a short time, the contracts and ten"" ders would be prepared. Now, this system of anticipating the consent of Parliament to works of such magnitude, is one which the Corporation ought to set its face against in the most solemn manner. Executing works which "" would be appli"" cable to any plan that might be hereafter "" adopted !"" Why, was there ever such a thing heard of before ? Anything the Dock Committee do which is not authorised, will be undertaken at their peril. They were ordered in the Act of 1855, to go to Parliament this year for powers to complete the docks. But instead of complying with this portion of the Birkenhead Dock Act of last session, they went forth with an entirely new scheme, or revival of effete crochets, and their Bill was thrown out, without giving them time to go into the "" merits "" of their old prcjects re-hashed. And if they should persist in carrying those plans forward, relying on their being applicable to any plan which may be hereafter adopted what will the next Committee they appear before say to them ? They can, with some show of consistency, follow up Mr. RENDEL'S plan, and if they attempt to run any further risk the Council should, at once, set their veto upon any such novel and dangerous proposal. Meanwhile it remains for the Chairman of the Birkenhead meeting to explain the meaning of his observations with regard to the works about to be undertaken, as it appears the Corporation intend to carry out Mr. RENDEL'S plan.  Tun creditor interest is paramount in Parliament. Debt is now treated of as unmitigated fraud, and we have the debtor all but in irons. This might do very well in a land where all men were rogues, and if the ledgers of a commercial country had not a debit and credit side. It appears to be a necessary sequence, that where all traders are creditors all must be debtors. There is scarcely a man engaged in any commercial pursuit who is not in debt. It would be impossible to carry on the business of this mercantile country in the absence of what is called "" trust."" The superstructure of our social exist ence has been raised on mutual confidence, and if we judge from the general appearance of England at the present moment, we think that the faith we have placed in one another has not been very grossly abused. To keep engagements is the great struggle of business life. The successful  man passes on from year to year without observation, and the amount of his liabilities are never The unfortunate  known, nor is it necessary ",1850

Til elQa ore  There are hosts of others who get into debt in what is thought a less legitimate way, and others who have no means of paying anybody. These two classes of debtors constitute only a wretchedly small fractional part of the immense debtor interest. That there is such an interest, and that it ought to be protected no one will pretend to deny. Our bankruptcy laws were originally formed for the protection of the trade defaulter, and the Insolvent Act for the. relief of all debtors. The exis tence of these statutes proves that the debtor interest was recognised, and treated with earnest solicitude by a former Legislature. Our civil jurisprudence had scarcely assumed a constitutional and intelligible shape, when the Bankrupt and Insolvent Courts were established. Previously debt was often used for the purest purposes of prosecution, and we can all remember seeing the little boxes on prison doors, and baskets hanging from the windows of gaols, with the memorable appeal—"" Remember the Poor Debtor."" Men known to be wealthy were not unfrequently the recipients of the bounty bestowed on the supposed mendicant. Incarcerated by a single creditor, and robbed by his nearest friend, the debtor was cruelly plundered, and the others whom he ought to have paid were openly swindled.  Bankruptcy and Insolvency have removed the possibility of such things being done in these days. The Chancery victim alone is left for life in prison without a chance of a re lease, or redress for his sufferings. If the debtor will not submit an account of his dealings to his creditors. they can compel him to do so, cr send him to a felon's prison. If, when he has accounted for all his acts, if fraud can be proved against him, he can be dealt with as a criminal. If men contract debts which they have no means of paying, and obtain goods under false pretences, they can be indicted, and punished summarily, or sent for trial by a jury. And with these means of making those who have property disgorge all they possess, of punishing the fraudu lent debtor and swindler, the creditor interest are not satisfied. They must make debtors' prisons what the abode of felons ought to be, and they take from the debtor who they cannot punish with all the doors the law leaves open to them, all those little comforts and indulgences which would render the breaking down of an honest man less painful to his friends and less agonising to himself. This is carrying paltry persecution to its greatest limit. It is making England too Continental for Englishmen. It is giving the prosperous man too much power over the unfortunate tradesman and thoughtless spendthrift.  The man who is not indictable for his acts cannot be guilty of offence against his creditors, and as a simple debtor he ought to be treated as an innocent subject. These were the ideas entertained by the popularity-seeking Whigs only a very few years ago. We remember certain Ministers now in office talking largely about the propriety of abolishing arrest for debt— the folly of locking men up because they were in difficulties—the wickedness of sending the unfortunate to gaol—and all that professional liberalism which sounds so well in an electioneering ballad. A score years, or so, mattes a wonderful change in the general character of our political carols. We either have a cataclysm of purity in those  compositions, or a frightful mixture of falsified pledges and.forgotton vows. We are glad, however, to find the legislature are about to discuss a bill which will give the creditor interest the power of enforcing judgments obtained in any competent court in England, Ireland, or Scotland, by means of execution, in all parts of the United Kingdom. And our readers will all agree with Mr. HADFIELD in saying that it is quite right to do away with the existing distinctions where there are but "" one sovereign and one government "" Let the creditor have all he can ask in justice for his protection, and let the debtor be treated as an honest man deserves, and punished for fraud when it is proved, as the law directs. At present he neither enjoys the immunities of honesty nor the penalties directed against cheating. ",1850

The tone of the Manchester Goods Market has been very buoyant to day, and a more extensive business has been done than for some time past. Prices for both goods and yarns show a gradually upward tendency. Advices from the French wool markets report a rather dull business in consequence of the wools of this year's clip not coming to market earlier. At Bourges, the clip of this year having been kept back by the bad weather, the wools have not arrived so abundantly from the wool growers as they did last season, and consequently sales have not been active. Buyers do not exhibit much anxiety to purchase. Prices at the close of the fair on the 28th June remained without variation, at the same quotations with which it opened, viz., if to if 15c per half kilo. At Chalon-sur-Marne the market closed on Saturday at the same prices obtained last year, being'2f 500 to 2f 80c. per half kilo for fine washed wools, and a superior lot brought from 2f 90e to 3f. At Chartres about 430 waggon loads arrived on the fair ground on Saturday, but the day passed over without any sales being effected ; and it was understood that none would take placq until Monday. The ruling quotations were ;—For wool in grease, Ist quality 2f 40c per kilo, 2nd ditto 2f 20c, and 3rd ditto 2f ; lambs' wool, Ist quality 3f 50c, 2nd ditto 3f 20c, and 3rd ditto 2f 80c.  Contrary to an opinion entertained in many quarters, the Bank of England Directors have adjourned their Board meeting without making any change in the minimum rate of discount, but this has caused no serious disappointment, since it is well understood that although the reduction has not been effected today, it cannot be delayed much longer, supposing of course monetary affairs remain in their present favourable condition. It is expected that in the course of the present week half a million sterling of gold will be received from Constantinople.

Mr. Dodd appeared on behalf of the prisoner. Detective officer Scott deposed, that he arrested the priprisoner on the 27th of June, and on the following day he went to the parish of Walton-on-the-hill, and procured a certificate of marriage between John Tempest and Martha Maria Buchanan. He also obtained, at the Holy Trinity church, Birkenhead, a certificate of marri ge solemnised on the 6th of June, 1851, by the Rev. Dr. Baylee, between John Roughey Tempest and Jane MacKenzie Harkness, widow.  In answer to Mr. D the witness eta ed, that the first wife was the original mover in the prosecution. The Rev. Dr. Baylee deposed, that he performed the marriage service between John Ronghev Tempest and Jane Mackenzie Harkness, on the sth of June, 1851. He could not speak as to the identity of the prisoner. The woman had lived as a servant in his house for about three months. To Mr. Dodd : Hod nothing to complain of her habits. She was not a servant. She might have chosen to remain ; but she was not dismissed—she left of her own accord. Robert Poole deposed, that he resided near Oswestry, Shropshire, and had known the prisoner before his first marriage. Was present in Dr. Bavlee's church on the sth of June, 1831, and saw the prisoner married to Mrs. MacKenzie.  Mary 13uolianan deposed that she was present at Walton church when the prisoner was married to her sister, Martha Maria Buchanan.  This was the case for the prosecution. Mr. Dodd said as the magistrates would probably feel themselves bound to send the case before another tribunal, his application at present was simply that the prisoner should be admitted to hail. As he was instructed, the prisoner and his first wife lived together some six or seven months after their marriage. It proved for his clent a most unhappy and disastrous marriage, for the woman was gi en to haVile of intemperance, and to a violent temper, to such a degree that it was impossible they could live together, In point of fact, she left him, and even after she left him she frequently followed him to his lodgings in a state of intoxication, annoyed hint, assaulted him, and made it impossible that he could endure her. The prisoner had violated the law, it was true, but there were so many circumstances palliating his conduct, that any punishment inflicted at the assizes would be probably merely nominal. Under these circumstances, Mr. Dodd applied to have bail taken. Elizabeth Williams was called as a witness by Mr. Dodd, and deposed that she was acquainted with the prisoner and his first wife. The wife lodged with her after the marriage. She came alone and took the lodgings. The prisoner came soma time after, to demand some of hie wearing apparel, which she had taken, and which he got from her after a great deal of trouble. She struck him on the head, threw a candlestick and lighted candle at him, and spat in his face. On one occasion she took her (witness's) husband upstairs' and gave him a glass of whiskey. As they remained abo'e a long time, witness went op and found Mrs. Tempest in bed, and her (witness's) husband lying at the foot of the bed. He appeared quite stupifled, and he told her subsequently that the whiskey must have been drugged, it made him in such a state. She very Beldam saw Mrs. Tempest sober. The prisoner had lodged with her for two years previously. She sever saw or met with any husband who bore such treatment as be bore from his wife. He never lifted his hand to her whatever she did. Has no doubt they would have lived very happily together if she had conducted herself differently, Mr. Campbell said the Bench were unanimously of opinion that they could not admit the prisoner to bail. The prisoner was accordingly committed to take his trial at the next assizes.  - ------The Emperor Nap Aeon left Paris on Tuesday for Plombieres, m here he mill remain two or three weeks. OUTRAGE TN CILAPEL—On Monday, at the Guildhall Police Court, Mr. Edward Char:es Merrick Dyer, 21 years of age, and respectably connected, was charged with creating- a disturbance in the Roman Catholic chapel, Moorfields, during the performance of Divine service. John Jennings, collector at St. Mary's chapel, Moorfields, said—On Sunday, Cardinal Wiseman preached, and a large congregation was attracted. The prisoner, who sat near the pulpit, drew from his pocket a Testament, and after referring to it exclaimed in an audible voice, at some point in the cardinal's sermon— "" That is a great lie ; you are the Scarlet Whore of Babylon."" This interruption caused great confusion among the congregation, .and resulted in the suspension of the service until the prisoner was s.cured and removed from the chapel. He made no resistance, but at the station he showed some anxiety for the safety of a paper containing a number of entries upon religious matters. The prisoner had walked from Chertsey during Saturday night. The prisoner said he could give no reason for his conduct, but that he could not command himself. lie had been ill and much harassed, and disappointed in his endeavours to get employment in the church as a lay missionary. The officer said from what the prisoner told him, it appeared he had been trying for the last three months, to obtain the appointment of a lay missionary preacher. Ultimately the prisoner gave the name of a merchant in the city, who attended; and at the suggestion of Alderman Carden, undertook to send Wino to his family.

The newly e'ected members made the necessary declarations, as prescribed by the public health act. The next busine,,s transacted was the elections of committees for transacing the business of the board for the ensuing year, and after some little discussion, in the course of which some father personal observations were made, it was agreed that the following gentlemen should compose THE WORKS AND HEALTH COMMITTEE. Messrs. Penny, Wilson, Caine, Littledale, Hughes, W. Colborne, and Ball.  THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. The following gentlemen were appointed members of this committee :—Rev. E. Roberts, Messrs. W. Chambers, Edward Colborne, Singlehurst, Fishwick, Neville, and Odell. THE SPECIAL FERRY COMMITTEE. This committee is thus constituted:—Messrs. Littledale, Corrie, Fiahwick, Hughes, and the Rev. E. Roberts. Prior to the appointment of this committee, Mr. Odell suggested to the board that it would be much more advisable for them to attend to the hutiness of the townships than to interfere with the ferries, with which the board had nothing whatever to do. He then stated that in Seacombe there were seventeen persons living in one house, not four yards square, and thought that the board would be much better emplo)ed in directing the attention of the inspector of nuisances to such a monster nuisance, than in meddling with matters which formed no part of their duties. In his opinion, if such direlicions of duty were made known to the board in London, they would be severely censured for neglecting their legitimate duties. Mr. Cain thought that the party who was cognisant of the case should have reported it to the board. The Clerk stated that if he bad received such information it would have been immediately attended to. After some conversation as to the appointment of the hour at which each committee should meet, which having been decided on,  The Chairman thanked Mr. Odell on behalf of the board, and said the subject he had mentioned should have the immediate consideration of the health committee.

Palmer, Robinson, Brocklebank, Evans, Gregson, Holme, Barber,  Mondell, Anderson, Ilubback, Bold, Rankin, and Smith. The annual excursion of the committee to inspect the lightships was fixed for Monday, the 14th inst„ and it was arranged that the members of the Town Council be invited.  The tender of Messrs. Holme and Nicholl was accepted for the construction of an office on the King's pier, for the water guard of the Customs.  It was announced that the first discharge of goods into the new Wapping warehouse had taken place; and a letter was read from the Board of Customs approving of the warehouses and vaults as stores for bonded goods upon the usual forms being complied with. The marine committee recommended that the offer of Messrs. Cato, Miller & Co.be accepted to repair, for £lO7 145., the damage done to the lightship Albert by the vessel Arran, on the 7th ultimo.  A letter was read from the surveyor, placing the King and Queen's half-tide (locks, and the working of the gates, under the charge of the harbour masters, from the 2nd instant.  A plan was produced for bricking up a portion of the sheds on the quay of the Wellington Dock at an estimated cost of 428.  Wednesday, the 9th:linstant, was fixed as the day for the annual revision of the list of voters under the dock act, and Messrs. Gregson and Smith undertook to perform the duty.  A letter was read from Messrs. McClune & Tamplin, calling attention to the insufficient berth allotted to their London, Bristol, and Plymouth steamers in the Coiling wood dock, and requesting that they might be permitted to remove to the berth formerly occupied by them in the Nelson dock.  The letter was referred to the harbour masters' com— mittee.  A letter was read from Messrs. D. & J. M'Donald, in reference to a claim made upon them for damages sustained by the Mirzapore having upset in the Prince's basin on the 9th ultimo, in consequence of the bank having been allowed to accumulate to a considerable height. The writers urged a claim on the dock committee for the damage, and suggested that the question should be referred to arbitration.  The Chairman said the committee were informed that the vessel was acting against the instructions of the gateman at the time she caught the bank. The subject was referred to the harbour masters committee.  A letter was read from the Rev. T. M. Lester, incumbent of Kirkdale, requesting that the committee would make the usual grant of £5O towards the maintenance of a licensed :room for the performance of Divine Service on the north shore. The letter stated that as St. Aiden's church was about to be immediately opened, the application was made for the last time.  Mr. Evans: Have we had any enquiry into the religion of the working people there ? I believe the majority of them are not in the church.  The Chairman : We are informed that the room is filled.  Mr. Smith said he believed it was not filled by the working people connected with the dock works. The Chairman : The clergyman represents to us that it is.  Mr. Anderson said he was well acquainted with the locality, and could state that much good was done by having the room there. As St. Aiden's Church was opened last week, there would, of course, be no further claim.  Mr. Barber : If I recollect rightly, the previous application was to have been the last.  The application was ordered to be granted. Mr. Evans ; I move that this be recorded as the last grant.  The Chairman : Certainly, it shall be so recorded. Mr. Mondell drew attention to the total inadequacy of the means at present in use for getting yessels in and out of the docks. When vessels were only of 500 tons, these appliances sufficed, but they were totally unfitted for ships of 2,000 or 2,500 tons. He referred, as an instance, to a letter recently received from Mr. M'lver regarding the steam hip Persia. He suggested that steam-power should he brought into requisition, and that 20-horse po-ker engines should be placed on some of the principal pier-heads for the purpose of warping vessels into and out of the docks.  Mr. Brocklebank said the object might be gained by having further privileges allowed to steamers to come into the dock basins to bring vessels out.  The Chairman suggested that the question should be referred to the harbour masters' committee to bring up some recommendation.  The suggestion was agreed to. This concluded the general business  HEALTH COMMITTEE,-YESTERDAY.  The usual weekly meeting of this committee was held at half past two o'clock, yesterday, in the town hall, Mr. Langedale in the chair.  Other members present : Messrs. Beckwith, M Guffie, Dover, Godfrey, Sheil, Haydoek, Stewart, Hodson, and Crosthwaite.  HEALTH OF THE TOWN  The medical officer of health reported a continuance of the low rate of mortality which has prevailed fur the last three months, the deaths in the borough during the week ending last Sa'urday having been 164, or 74' less than the corrected average of the same week of the preceding eight years. In the parish there were 110 deaths ; in the outtownships, 54. The propartion of deaths from diseases of the zymotic class was larger than it has been of late. Of6o deaths ascribed to these diseases, 14 were from diarrhoea (the average being 11), 13 from measles, 9 from scaritina, 6 from typhus, 3 from smallpox (unvaccinated), and 1 from syphilis. A female, aged 68, died from English cholera. A child, two years of age, died from typhoid fever, caused by exposure to the fumes of a midden. Diseases of the lungs caused 42 deaths, being 22 fewer than in the previous week. The mean temperature of the week was 61 6-10 degrees, slightly below the average. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the temperature was high, the maximum on the two latter days being 70 4-10 degrees. The wind was from the north-west. The rain fell was only 6-100ths of an inch.  The borough engineer, building surveyor, and inspector of nuisances reports various particulars of the operations in their several departments during the week, from which it appeared that 135 nuisances complained of by inhabitants had been inspected, and means taken to remedy them. 1,448 houses in the unhealthiest districts containing 4,775 apartments, and 562 cellars had been put under examination with the view to improve their sanitory condition. The inspector of nuisances regretted that he had to report that Mr. Nathan Ellison, one of the contractors, had began to place market refuse and fish garbage in a pit situate on land between Great Homer Street and Scotland Road which smells badly, and is much complained of by the inhabitants. Twenty-four hour's notice has been given to Mr. Elliston to remove it, and discontinue the practice. The borough engineer submitted plans for public waiting rooms in Clayton Square. They were generally approved. One building will first be erected in Clayton Square, as an experiment, and if it should prove successful similar buildings will be opened along the various lines of omnibus traffic. This concluded the general business,  THE "" LATCH-KEY"" DENIED.—The married ladies of Honolulu have lately presented a petition to the Legislature, praying for the suppression of theatres and circuses, on the ground that they kept their husbands out all night. SIR JOHN NEWPORT'S PROPERTY.—The lands of Rathculliheen (part of) and Snowhaven, containing 163 a. 2r. 38p., known as "" Sir John's,"" near this city, which were sold on last Friday in the cumbered Estates' Court for £5,750, havelbeen purchased for Colonel Sheil, brother of the late Richard Lalor Sheil, where the gallant Colonel intends fixing his future residence.—Waterford NewsTHE LATE CAPT. THOMPSON.—We are glad to be able to announce that it is the intention of the Government to make provision for the distressing case of Mrs. Thompson, the widowed mother of the gallant defender of Kars. In reply to a question from the Earl of Malmesburv, the Marquis of Lansdnwn stated in the House of Lords that the Government had determined to come to the relief of Mrs. Thompson, and that would be done partly through the War Office and partly through other channels.  - THE MURDER AT SPONDON.—The atrocious murder perpetrated on the high road, near Spondon, still remains shrouded in mystery. The police officers and local constables, have been indefatigable in their efforts to discover the perpetrators of the foul deed. It was naturally supposed on Tuesday, that the hamper which Stone had with him contained a considerable quantity of clothing, but his son states that the shirt, pair of stockings, and a handkerchief, found scattered on the road, were all the articles which he sent from Appleby Hall to be washed—thus the motive which first suggested itself for the butal attack, (that of plunder,) is shown to be groundless, unless, indeed, the murderers were disturbed in their fearful work. The time at which the tragedy was perpetrated is fixed ; it must have taken place between twenty minutes and half-past eleven o clock, several witnesses speaking positively upon this point. One of them, Wm. Peat, of Ochhrook, left Derby Nat half-past ten, and walked leisurely towards Spondon ; and walking an hour to within a few minutes, and when between the turn-pike road and the village of Spondon, on the footpath, he heard the cry of ""murder"" distinctly uttered, but hearing other voices as of persons engaged in altercation, he did not turn back, thinking that some parties the worse for liquor, were ""larking."" Another witness, John Wheeldon, of Ockbrook, left the Chesterfield Arms at five minutes to eleven o'clock, and. in company with another young man, overtook the deceased, and bade him good night. The kindly wish was answered, and they proceeded forward, meeting no one until about 20 yards, when they met two men, whom also they wished good night, but received no reply. These men, (at present unknown,) it is calculated, must have met Stone at the precise spot where he came by his death, and at the identical time when Peat heard the cry of "" murder."" The two Irish. men and a sailor, in custody on suspicion of being concerned in the murder, were brought before the county magistrates of Derby, and discharged, no further evidence having been 'obtained against them. A woman, found upon the road soon after the murder was committed, and who gave a very confused account of her proceedings, is still detained.  MEETING OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION  A meeting of the medical profession of Liverpool and its vicinity was held in the lecture hall of the Medical Institution, Hope-street, at seven o'clock last night, for the purpose of considering the best mode of conducting elections of honorary medical officers to the public charities. There was not a very numerous attendance of medical gentlemen. The chair was taken by Dr. Bickersteth.  The Chairman stated that the present meeting was called in consequence of a resolution passed at a meeting of the medical institution, held in April. The resolution, which was proposed by Mr. Desmond, was condemnatory of the practice of canvassing for appointment to offices under public charities, as being derogatory to the profession, and harassing to the trustees. A committee was appointed to carry out that resolution, and a generally favourable reply had been received from the Infirmaries and other quarters to which the resolution was submitted.  Mr. Long proposed the first resolution. 111 strongly condemned she practice of canvassing, and opposed the general idea that such a system procured the alvantage of extended practice to a medical man. The resoluti n was as follows—"" We, the members of the medical profession, resident in Liverpool and its vicinity, believe that the election of honorary medical officers to the public charities, through means of canvassing, whether by personal application, circular, newspaper advertisement, organised agency of friends, or otherwise, is unworthy of the members of a liberal profession, and cannot secure the election of the most worthy candidate, but only of the m)st active canvasser.""  Dr. Cameron seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously.  Dr. Maclntire proposed the second resolution, which was as follows :—"" We, therefore, declare that we will not in future canvass for any honorary medical appointments ourselves; and we shall regard any medical man who may resort to canvassing in any form as forgetful of the true interests of his profession."" The speaker advocated the importance of adopting this resolution as a necessary corallery of the de laration contained in the first. Dr. Imlach seconded the resolution, observing that the practice of canvassing, i 1 not absolutely wrong, was decidedly unworthy of the profession. Even those who now found it necessary to canvass, while no decided arrangement existed to the contrary, admitted that it was an evil, and that it would be well all should join in getting rid of it.  Mr. Steele thought, with so comparatively small a number of the profession present, it would be assuming too much to pass a resolution which dictated so decisively regarding the future course to be adopted. He urged that the profession of the town had not had a sufficient opportunity of coming for ward to discuss the question. It had not been sufficiently advertised, and unless it were agreed to universally, or at least to a large extent, the resolution would be wholly ineffective. He was not in favour of canvassing for honourary appointments, or perhaps for accepting such appointments at all, because he thought they should show that they placed a proper value upon their services, but at the present moment he did not think it would be judicious to pass such a resolution. Dr. Nevins proposed the following as an amendment : "" We therefore declare that we will not in future canvass for any honorary medical appointment to any charity which shall have adopted a plan of election by which canvassing may be dispensed with."" He urged that this resolution would sufficiently express the opinion of the profession, and would at the same time allow the medical charities the opportunity of altering their plan of election, where alteration was required to meet the wishes of the medical profession. Mr. Grinsdale seconded the resolution.  Mr. Behrend proposed a second amendment, to the effect, that the meeting adopt no pledge whatever.  Mr. Lewis seconded this amendment  Mr. Hakes proposed a third amendment, to the effect, that the resoluti n first passed be submitted to the public charities, with the view of having some plan adopted to obviate the necessity of canvassing.  Mr. Ellis Jones seconded the third amendment. Considerable discussion took place on the severrl propositions. The meeting finally divided upon the second amendment, the third amendment having been withdrawn. The second amendment was lost by sixteen to eleven. The first amendment was then put, and carried by sixteen to twelve. The original resolution was therefore lost, and the amendment of Dr. Nevins became the adopted resolution of the meeting. Mr. Desmond provsed a plan for the conducting of future elections, to be submitted to the public charities, as a ground work for them ninon which to act, if they approved of it. The general effect of the plan proposed was, that when a vacancy took place it Ehoul I be advertised, and each candidate be directed to fill up, and send to the institution, a form of application, stating qualifications, length of time in practice, whether holding any other public appointment, and similar particulars. A copy of all the filled up farms should be sent to each voter, along with a form of proxy, which the voter should fill up with the name of the candidate for whom he desired to vote. When all bad been filled up, the name of the successful candidate might then be made known to the public on the day appointed for the election. Mr. Banner seconded the resolution.  Dr. Imlach mentioned that the plan brought forward was adopted from a pamphlet published by Dr. Sutherland in 1845.  Mr. Hakes suggested that a recommendation to have every election conducted altogether by proxy, be made a prominent part of the plan. Mr. Behrend moved an amendment to the effect, that the public charities be recommended to conduct the elections in future, by the committee and the medical boards of the respective charities, without the general body of subscribers. (Crie4 of '' No, no."") This amendment was not seconded, and therefore fell to the ground. After a very desultory discussion, (luring which several amendments were proposed, and either not seconded or withdrawn, Mr. Desmond's resolution was put and carried by a large majority. Mr. Rakes proposed that a second plan bo also submitted to the public charities, to the effect that future elections be conducted by a committee of each institution. Mr. Desmond seconded the resolution.  A long discussion took place, after which, Dr. Iligginson moved, as an amendment, the previous question, which was seconded by Dr. Maclntyre, and carried. It was then agreed that the secretary, Mr. Fletcher, forward copies of the resolutions to the committees of the public charities, and request their co-operation in the objects of the meeting.  The cDmmittec by which the meeting was organised was re-appointed, to confer with the different public charities. The proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to the chairman. ",1850

The second exhibition of the Liverpool and Horticultural Society of plants, fruits, flowers, and vegetables, was held yesterday at the Botanic Gardens. The success that attended this gathering was complete : the weather was most propitious (for it really was a summer's day), and there was no lack of nature's best flowers decked in their brightest and gayest attire, to give eclat to the occasion. On entering the spacious marquee which had been made still more capacious to meet the requirements of the day, no person could avoid being struck by the beautiful and magnificent display of "" heaths there exhibited in every variety. Too much praise cannot be passed upon Mr. Farrie and Mr. Bibby for their beautiful specimens, which, not only carried off all the prizes, but far outstripped all competitors. Passing from the heaths, we were led to the pelargoniums, which showed out in great brilliancy. Their exquisite foliage and beautiful-tinted flowers formed a rema, kable contrast with the many coloured dresses of the fair visitors, who hang over these specimens for the hour, with unalloyed admiration. In this department it will be seen that Mrs. Stringer bore off the palm of the day, an 1 the specimens she displayed far eclipsed anything that has heretofore been seen, not only in this county, but those that have been exhibited in what has been designated the Garden of England—or the great Chadwick exhibitions. To attempt to describe the variety of fuschias, would indeed be a work of supererogation—for where all was perfection it would be invidious indeed to select particular exhibitors but the specimens shown by Messrs. Peake, Clare, and Rawdon, far surpassed any thing, that we have before seen, and at once manifested the care and attention that those persons must have devoted to the culture of that most beautiful plant. The exhibition of roses was large ; but as Mr. Griffith has devoted so much time and attention to the culture of this beautiful flower—the emblem of England—he has so far surpassed all competitors that, on the present occasion, he had but fear to contend against, and hence all the prizes were awarded—and most justly—to himself. The show of exotic orchidacem and stove and greenhouse plants was much larger than usual. Amongst the specimens exhibited there were plants which are indigenous to New South Wales, the Cape of Good Hope, Australia, Java, and New Holland. The display of liliums:was but small, but several beautiful single specimens were exhibited. There was a good show of ferns, and it is much to be hoped that more attention will be devoted to this department of floriculture, for this species of plants, from their extreme beauty, are well deserving of attention. Having thus given but a brief outline of the principal plants, we must now turn our attention to the fruits. Here indeed was a splendid show—all was perfection—and from the subjoined list of prizes awarded, it will be seen that Mr. William Jackson, M.P., carried off the principal prizes, for peaches and nectarines, showing at once the deserved superiority that gentleman had attained in bringing to perfection those luscious fruits. The crapes were also most magnificent. The vegetable table was well filled, and attracted great attention. The following is the list of successful competitors who, on this occasion, were awarded prizes : Heaths (six specimens greenhouse, all distinct varieties) : Ist prize, Mr. A. Farrie, H.

The rush to Dunolly is still progressing, and there are now upwards of 16,000 people on the field ; the distance from Maryborough is 13 miles, on the Korong road. A correspondent on the Ovens field informs us that the rush to the N.S.W. field has subsided ; many have returned from the Rocky River, and this has had the effect of making the diggers on that rich field quite resigned to their ounce of gold per diem. At the Anderson Creek diggings some new ground has been opened, the success attending which we have not yet heard. Some capital machinery is now being removed to that field, and we have every reason to believe it will prove a profitable speculation, as the quartz is very good. The Steiglitz gold field is rapidly becoming more productive from the rich quartz, and we hope the government will soon establish an escort to that place. At present, though only 16 miles from Geelong, there is no way of getting the gold to Melbourne, as the government will not allow gold to be forwarded by escort from Geelong to Melbourne, and by this means the miners arc not receiving the full value of their gold. The silver brought to town, said to be from the mine recently discovered on the Coliban River, is now on view at our office. Its analysis gives about 90 per cent, of silver, alloyed with copper and a small proportion of gold. We trust soon to be furnished with specimens of the mineral from the mine.

GARROTING A FEMALE.—Christopher Thomas was charged with having at Manchester, on the 24th of September, violently assaulted and robbed Fanny Maybury. The prosccutrix was the wife of a man named George Maybury, and on the night in question, about eleven o'clock, was coming home along Oldham-road, after having received some wages for her husband from his employer, a chairmaker, named O'Connell, when she was followed by the prisoner, and another man not in custody. They caught her by the throat, and choked her in regular garrotte fashion, and then robbed her of the few shillings she had in her possession. The woman remained insensible on the ground until she was found soon after and carried home. She knew the prisoner by 1 face and name before the outrage, and he was accordingly arrested and identified by her. Some other articles of property, such as a cap, a shawl, a box, and a fish she had bought, were stated by the woman to have been taken by the prisoner. None of these arti I,s were found in his possession when arrested. The jury found the prisoner guilty. Sentence deferred. CHARGE OF GAILROIING.—Thomas Hansall, a boy of 16, described as a fustian coact.; was charged with having been one of a party who feloniously assaulted Francis Strahan, and with great violence robbed him of a watch, four shillings, and other articles. The proseeutor stated that on the Ist of October, abetit half-past eleven at night he was going home, and in passing through Deansgate he 31W the prisoner, who appeared to watch him closely. Ile turned into R.ainford street, and was proceeding on, when he was seized by two men, one of whom squeezed his throat, white a boy, whom he stated to be the prisoner, rifled his pocket. The evidence of identity was very uncertain, and his lordship directed an acquittal of the prisoner.' BURGLARL—SamueI Fisher, aged 22, tailor, was charged with having, on the night of the 26th October, at Manchester, feloniously and burglariously broken and entered the house of William Avers, and stolen a clock, three silk handkerchiefs, a waistcoat, and other articles. The prosecutor keeps a house called the Grapes Inn, Union street, Manchester. On the night in question, the servant girl was roused by some noise, and saw a light outside her door. Some oue looked in, but withdrew. She got up, and, coming to the door, saw a man, whom she stated to be the prisoner, with a light, which, as soon as she appeared, he blew out. She raised an alarm, and her master came down, but the burglar had escaped, and the property mentioned was gone. A man, whose occupation was knocking persons up every morning, deposed that he saw the prisoner, with two other men, in an entry leading into the house on the morning of the robbery. The prisoner was subsequently apprehended. Mr. Wheeler conducted the prosecution, and Mr. Tindal Atkinson defended. The vary found the prisoner not guilty. The court rose at six o'clock.  SECOND COIJKT. BEFORE MR. SERGEANT CHANNELL. BURGLARY AT SALFORD.—James Robinson, 20, fustian dresser, was placed at the bar charged with having burglariously entered the dwelling house of William Farrar, at Salford, on the 16th of September, and stolen therefrom 18 gallons of ale and a shawl. Mr. Raffles prosecuted, and Mr. Sowler defended the prisoner On the morning of the day in question the prosecutor's wife heard a noise in her b droom, at d on:her husband, whom she awoke, going down stairs, he found that the cellar window had been broken, and that an eighteen gallon cask had been emptied of its contents. His wife also missed a shawl from her bedroom, and this was fouel concealed in an umbrella at his lodgings. On cross examination, the prosecutor admitted that his wife had bad tea, on the evening preceding the robbery, with a man named 'corn Richards, hot he could not say what kind of cream they had- used. (Laughter.) His wife was not quite drunk, but she did not sleep in the same bed as he did. Mrs, Ferrer also admitted that she had had tea with Tommy Richards and five others, and that they bad a quartern of rum in the cream. (Laughter.) The prisoner previously lodged in the house, and knew how to open the cellar window from the outside. Mr. Bawler, for the defence, urged that the most probable explanation of the else was that Mrs. Ferrer having been overcome by the "" cream,"" had, during the evening, visited the cellar to draw some ale, and that forgetting to turn the cock, the liquor had run waste. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty, and the prisoner was discharged, after ate admonition from his lordship to reform his rife, which was admitted to be of a dissolute charecter. STABBING AT PRESTON.—Robert Ogden, 29, handloom weaver, was placed in the dock charged witn having felonious'y slabbed Jane Overend' at Preston. on the night of the 7th of September, with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. Mr. Cross prosecuted, and Mr. Wigham defended the prisoner. The prosecutrix is one of the unfortunate class of women who walk the town, and, on the night in question she, with two or three compenions, was pursuing her miserable calling. She returned to her house, in Green street Preston, about three or four o'clock, the following morning (Sunday), and as she was about to close the shutters, the prisoner came np and pulled her by the clothes. She pushed him in return, whereupon the prisoner drew a knife and stabbed her in the side. He immediately took to flight and was pursued by the prosecatrix. She soon, however, became taint from loss of blood, and fell insensible in the street. She was removed to the house of recovery, and there lay for mono than a fortnight in a very precarious state. The sergeant of police who was examined for the prosecution, stated that Cee prisoner was married, and that he was a man of good character. Mr. Wigham strongly urged this evidence in faveir of the prisoner, and eonteneed that it was a case of mistaken identity. The jury returned a verdict of ""unlawfully wounding. Sentence was deferred. ARSON AT TOXTETH PARK.—Patrick Keogh, 23, hawker, was indicted for haying at Toxteth Park, on the 18th September last. feloniously set fire to two stacks of wheat, the property of Thomas Aspinall. Mr. Hornby prosecuted. The prisoner was undefended. Ile admitted that it was he who set fire to the stacks, but alleged that it was done through accident. On the evening of the day in question, the was seen by Mr. Aspinall'e servants entering the haggard, but no further notice was taken of him. The family retired to rest at their usual hour, end at that time, all seemed quiet about the premises. At two o'clock in the morning, one of the workmen was aroused by seeing flames burst from one of the stacks. He promptly gave the alarm, but the flames, being wafted by the wind, communicated the fire to two adjoining stacks, and raged so furiously that in spite of all efforts to suppress them, the three stacks were totally consumed in a short time. They were valued at £l5O. Shortly after the discovery of the fire, Constable 41 of the Liverpool force met the prisoner walking towards town. He accosted the prisoner, and the latter after a moment's hesitation, told him that he had set fire to the stuck, but it was accidentally. He said that the night being very wet, and having no money wherewith to procure a lodging, he went to sleep under the stack. In the course of the night he lit hit pipe, and, unhappily, the match which he used set fire to the stack. When taken to the p lice station he was searched, but no money was found on his person. A pipe full of tobacco and a few articles of sham jewellery of the most trifling value were the only things found in his possession. There being no reason to doubt his statement, the jury returned a verdiot of not guilty. BURGLARY AT ORMSKIRE..—Thomas Rimmer,lB, labourer, was indicted for having, at Aughton, near Ormskirk, on the 12th October last, burglariously broken and entered the dwelling house of Jeffery Robinson. and stolen therefrom £lO, the moneys of the said Jt fferey Robinson. Mr. Simon prosecuted. The prisoner was undefended. The prosecutor is a farmer residing at Aughton, near Ormskirk, and shortly before the period of the robbery the prisoner was in his employment as farm servant. While so employed be became well acquainted with the habits of the family, and the place where the prosecutor kept his money. On the day of the robbery he was away from home on business, and left his house and family (his wife being of unsound mind) in charge of a little girl about 12 years of age. The prisoner was aware of this, and lost no time in availing himself of the opportunity to rob the house. He was drinking in the evening with a number of men in the public house adjoining the prosecutor's dwelling, and while they were making merry he left their company for about half an hour. During his absence the landlady heard a noise in the prosecutot's house as if a lock was being broken, but at the time she took no notice of it. The prosecutor returned in the course of the night, and next morning he found that the house had been entered through the kitchen window, and that his chest had been broken, and £lO in gold taken from it. It was at once seen that the robbery had been committed by some one well acquainted with the house, and suspicion fell on the prisoner. It was known that before the robbery he was so poor that he could not pay a small debt of a few shillings, while immediately after be seemed ""flush of cash,"" and was to be found in every public house in the neighbourhood for several days subsequently, drinking and lavishly treating his acquaintances. He also gave four sovereigns to a person in the neighbourhood to keep for him. He was convicted, and sentenced to four years penal servitude. This is his first conviction, were it otherwise, he would have received severer punishment. SHEEP STEALING AT WEST DERBY.—George Smart, 18, Was indicted for having at West Derby, on the 3rd October last, feloniously stolen one sheep, the property of William Robinson and another. Mr. Raffles prosecuted, and Mr. Scott appeared for the prisoner. It seemed that a few days before the 3rd October, Henry Case the drover of Messrs. Robinson and Morgan, cattle salesmen, placed 138 sheep in a Field near West Derby, previous to their being sold at the re xt market at the Old Swan. He went to count them on the 4th, and missed two .if them. A sheep having the same ",1850

Mr. Churchwarden Woodruff was in the chair. The other vestrymen present were Messrs. Whitby, Cook, Syred, Smith, Denton, Mellor, Bairstow, Shaw, Crawford, J. Jones, Whitty, Satchell,Jackson, Brancker, Taylor, Crellen, Owen, Chesney, and Critchley. The Clerk read the minutes of the last meeting, which were adopted and confirmed.  THE WORKHOUSE COMMITTEE. The proceedings of this committee recommended the general board to accede to the previous recommendation for increasing the governor's salary £5O per annum, he henceforth employing his own domestic servants and all pauper servants to be withdrawn from the house. Mr. Shaw begged to move that the proceedings be confirmed. _ _  Mr. Denton seconded the motion. Mr. NV hitty requested to know whether the increase in the governor's salary was ircluded in those proceedings, or whether it did not require a special motion on the subject. Mr. Shaw : 1n fact it is not an increase of salary ; but es there might be some difference on the subject, he would give notice that he should at the next meeting move that the  increase be made. Mr. Dentm requested to know whether Mr. Weightman had furnished his accounts for the measurement of the  buildings ? The Chairman replied, that putting the question at that time was rather out of order, but he would, notwithstanding, answer it at once. He has not yet furnished the accounts. Mr. Denton thought such conduct on the part of Mr. Weiehtman exceedingly discourteous to the vestry. He had been repeatedly applied to for the measurement, and yet he would not produce them. He thought that some stens should be taken to insist on their production. Mr. Bairstow thought it was rather surprising that neither the contractor nor the sub-contractor had interfered  in the matter. Mr. Denton said the fact was that Mr. Weightman had nothing to do with the sub-contractor; if be had had, it would have been a very different thing. He concluded by moving that the clerk 'oe again instructed to take the necessary steps to obtain the production of the accounts.  THE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. The proceedings of this committee were read and confirmed without any comment, as they did net possess any feature of public interest.  THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. The proceedings of this committee were rather more voluminous than usual, and several matters had undergone investigation, amongst which was a letter from Col. North, stating that a man had been dismissed from the Liverpool workhouse ; that the watchman had given him 7s. 6d., and he had a list of places to call at on his way to London, written by a Mr. Thompson. This matter had been enquired into, and from the investigation then made it appeared that there was no foundation for the charge, and that there was not such a person as Thompson on the establishment; also, the case referred to them from the West Derby board of guardians, relative to the case of Mary Almond, who, it was alleged, had been refused relief. [The facts of this case appeared in this journal a fortnight since, when the case cme before the board.] All the parties concerned bad been examined, and the result of that examination was that the blame solely rested with the woman herself, who had made several statements on the subject. With regard to the complaint made by the police against Martin and Hughes, that case had also been investigated, and the two men told not to offend again. The Chairman, in reference to the case of the pauper Almond, said that the relieving officer of West Derby was to blame for not having relieved the woman, and then she would have not been found in the streets. With regard to a letter which bad appeared in print, from Mr. Hebback, the chairman expressed a hope that in future persons would be more ready to investigate cases before they made charges  Mr. Whitty : In the proceedings of the finance committee, there is something said about the payment of £6 for rectorial rent charge, he should like to know what the me ming of it was. The Chairman : It is a payment in relation to the Kirkdale Schools, and has been paid to Mr. Stewart: Mr. Whitty : Bat have we a right to pay it ? The Clerk : Ten years ago the subject was discussed, and it was then referred to Mr. Lowndes, who decided that the vestry was liable to pay it. The Chairman : Wished to know whether the payment of the amount should be deferred. Mr. Bairstow : It would be better. We can then see if we have a right to pay it. Mr. Satchell : I hope Mr. Chairman you are not going to take away Mr. Stewart's rights, as well as the rights of the rector. The Chairman : I am not going to take away any person's rights. Mr. Whitty : All we want is information. The Chairman supposed that Mr. Whitty had a right to ask a qiiesiion. Mr. Bairstow : To settle the question, I wish to move that the payment of the rectorial charges be postponed until the next meeting (cries of "" no, no""). Ido so only for the purpose of obtaining information. Mr. Chesney seconded the motion. Mr. Brancker : It is one of those payments that have been made for years, and why should we not pay it now. Mr. B iirstow : Because we have paid it for years, there can be no reason why we should not have information on it now. Mr. Satchell : It has been paid for years, and surely you would not in-ult Mr Stewart now by saying that he had been taking that which did not properly being to him. Mr. Whitty thought it was right that the vestry should have information on the subject to see if it was correct. They would not pay any other bill without first seeing all was right. Mr. Denton did not see that there could be any objection in deferring the payment under the circumstances. Mr, Brancker : But it is not like any tradesman's bill. Mr. Whitty could not see that it would do any harm in deferring the payment, so far as it being an established custom to pay it, he did not think from the experience they had recently bad on another subject, that that was any reason why it should be paid. He considered that the subject should be deferre I for fourteen days to have it examined into. The vestry then divided, when there were twelve in favour of the payment being deferred, and six for it being  paid. The motion was consequently carried, and the clerk was directed to be prepared by the next meeting with the facts of the case. After transacting some routine business the board adj ourned.  TreE No SURRENDER SRAM.—"" No surrender,"" was Lord Palmerston's motto. He insisted upon the fulfilment of the treaty of Paris according to its terms—denying that the Bolgrad point, or the question of the Isle of Serpents, was in any degree obscure or doubtful. He insisted, therefore, upon enforcement. We are assured, however, as if it qualified the concession, that "" our government has made it a sine qua non that no questions but those immediately referred to the congress are to be admitted for discussion."" If we read this explanation aright, it means that the dignity of our ministers is saved because they specially surrender only those very things the surrender of which they declared to be out of the question, while they are to retain them by the connivance of the French government. Is it so very certain that it will only be a dramatic performance in Paris—all show and no real concession ? In truth, we cannot feel any certainty on that score.—Spectator.  C,MMITTAL OP A HORSE STEALER AT WAKEFIELD.— On Monday, before the West Riding magistrates, at the Wakefield Court House, a young man, namel Wm. Henry Norbury. was charged with stealing a black horse, the property of Mr. W. Clayton, maltster, of Wakefield. The horse, which is worth £2O, was placed in a field at Sandal Magna, on the 10th of last month, and was there seen on the above date by several' witnesses. On Mr. Clayton going to the field next morning he found that the gate had been taken off its hinges, and that the horse had been stolen. An innkeeper, from Penistone, stated that on the day on which the horse was stolen the prisoner arrived at his house on a black horse, which Mr. Clayton has since identified as his property. He asked him to put the horse in the stable. He then wanted to borrow 155., and on being refused he immediately decamped, leaving the horse in the possession of the innkeeper. The innkeeper, on going to the police office, identified Norbury as the man who took the horse to his house at Penistone. The bench committed the prisoner to take his trial at the assizes. EXPEDITION IN SEARCH OF MISSING VESSELS —OR the application of certain shipowners of Dundee, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have ordered the Bulldog and Salamander steamers to proved immediately towards Archangel, in search of five merchant ships belonging to the port of D indee, which were from Archangel, homeward bound, and have now been missing for two months past. Each cf there ships has received on board preserved meats, warm clothing, boots, Sec considered necessary for the relief of the lost men should they happily be fallen in with. Both ships left Sheerness on Monday. The commanders are ordered, on their arrival in the Tay, to put themselves into early communication with the owners of the missing vessels at Dundee, where it is expected some experienced ship masters, old traders to Archangel, will be ready to proceed on board. Both ships will then proceed north until they make the Shetland Islands ; from thence they will steer north west, and proceed as tar north as latitude 64, provided they are not prevented by float or fixed ice, Their orders are to cruise for fourteen days, and then pro. teed to Cromarty, and report the result of their search.

The British Consul visited the Cameroons in the steamer Gambia, and held a palaver between the contending tribes. The Gambia brought from Fernando Po to Teneriffe several members of the Spanish missions and four coloured youths for training. Affairs at Lagos arc quiet, but an outbreak is hourly expected.

Railroad, roads, and bridges, were the order of the day, and uppermost in the public mind, not only at election meetings, but almost everywhere else. The construction of the great lines of railway between the capital and the gold fields, was to be prosecuted by the Government, and a Railway Board had been recently appointed, and was supposed to be busily employed in the preliminary details of vast and important undertakings. Already tenders had been accepted for the construction of 3 miles 77 chains and 38 links of the line between Melbourne and Williamstown, and 2 l contractors had tendered ; Messrs Thomas Miles and Co., being accepted for 20,8201. 7s. 41. Although the winter had not yet passed over, and the pools of mud which still formed many portions of the so-called roads to the diggings had not yet been dried up, the spirit of trade, and the indomitable perseverance which characterises workers in the hive, had kept pace with the wants of the mining population, and secured, if not briskness, at least vitality to the markets. The steady and increasing supply of gold, with the almost daily discovery of new deposits of the precious metal, were in themselves sufficiently cheering elements of commercial prosperity ; but when to these were added the wide spreading labours of farmers and agriculturists—the fast changing features of the country around—the wild bush disappearing for the cultivated plain—it was not difficul,-. to foresee a course of prosperity and plenty, which must ensure the improved condition and sound advancement of the colony. The returns of all kinds show a state af real prosperity and healthy trade, which under common prudence must lead to results as great, and much more lasting, than those of the past. Not that there was anything like excitement in trade, or even great buoyancy in commercial transactions. House property and land in  Melbourne was rising• The time of the Crown Court was yesterday taken up principally with the trial of garrotte robbery cases. Baron Alderson, in every case which was proved, and a verdict of guilty returned, was very unrelenting in his sentences, and we hope that his severity will prove a caution and a warning to the miscreants who are in the habit of infesting the lonely places of Liverpool, and pouncing upon those whom they think are unable to defend them selves. In our columns of today will be found a long correspondence in relation to the dispute between Sir Charles Napier and Sir Robert Peel, on the non-taking of Cronstadt. The gallant admiral is evidently of the opinion, that by receiving a missive from the Grand Duke Constantine, en dorsing his views, that he has succeeded in defending his character against his assailants. It would appear that Lord Palmerston refused Sir C. Napier an official investigation, which he had asked for in consequence of Sir R. Peel's statements, but his lordship at the same time communicated to Sir Charles his opinion that his con duct in the Baltic was judicious and proper, and founded on a correct sense of public duty ; that the fleet under his command was not sufficient for the double purpose of first attacking Cronsfaclt, and afterwards successfully encountering the Russian fleet, and that he acted with sound judg ment in refraining from attacking the fortress These, the Premier says, have always been his opinions on that point, although ho entirely disapproves of Sir Charles Napier's proceedings since, on shore. The Admiral, however, thinks that Lord Palmerston's opinion is insufficient to clear his reputation, and he reiterates his request for an investigation, at the same time forwarding a letter from the Grand Dike Constantine to himself, in which the Russian prince willingly declares that Sir Charles, in his "" Notes,"" quite exactly reported the conversation he had with him concerning Cronstadt, and that in the only conversation he had with Sir Robert Peel even the name of Cronstadt was never once mentioned. It will be remembered that, according to Sir Charles Napier, the Grand Duke was of opinion that he could not have successfully attacked Cronstadt ; while Sir Robert Peel, at Stafford, said there was only one opinion in the Russian navy, from the Grand Duke down to the smallest middy. and that was, that if Sir Charles had had pluck, and had done his duty, Cronstadt would have been crumbled to the dust. Such is the purport of the latest instalment of the Napier-Cronstadt controversy. The new Bishop of London has commenced his pastoral duties in a promising way. On ..Monday he presided at a meeting at Islington for church extension. The Bishop's speech, while recognising the vast amount of practical unchristianity in the country, was still of a hopeful character. He does not wish cathedrals and churches to be planted like fortresses throughout the land, holding only their own garrisons, and keeping the people aloof, but he almost insinuates a doubt that to a great extent such is the case. However, all the churches in the Islington district are made fully available ; still there are in that quarter of the metropolis between :10,000 and 40,000 people who might attend church, but either cannot, or will nor. A collection of between 5,0001. and 6,0001. was made at the meeting, the Bishop giving 6001.—50 that if more churches will Christianise the metropolitan heathens, the work seems likely to be done. Prizes were on Monday presented to successful students at Haileybury College. Colonel Sykes, in his address on the occasion, spoke of the Civil Servants of India as an unjustly abused body ; although he admitted the employment of torture on the miserable natives for the purpose of squeezing out of them the revenues which the masters of the Civil Service squander in wars to extend their sovereignty over unoffending Indian Princes and peoples. The Duke of Newcastle has delivered a short address at Newark on the defaets of public education. The chief of these, in the opinion of his Grace, springs from the present great industrial prosperity ; for young children, instead of being kept at school, are sent to work to get wages. The Duke would like to see that practice changed, but would regret legislative interference for the purpose,—as would also every person of common MISC. The foreign news this morning is of but slight importance. The Le Nord holds out the hope that in case the Conference shall declare the continued occupation of the Turkish territories and waters by Austria and England illegal, and shall recognise the right of Russia to construe the Treaty of March in the way she has done. Russia, on her side, may be willing to sacrifice this right for the maintenance of European peace, and to give up Bolgrad. In the meantime, reports differ much as to the probable grouping of the Powers on this question in the Conference. Most of them agree in describing Sardinia as having been induced to promise her vote to England, but the most important point, the decision of France is doubtful. The Protestant district-synods of Hungary are unanimous in repudiating the organic statute pro posed by the Government, as being contrary to the liberties granted and confirmed by numerous imperial ordinances to the Protestant church in Hungary, and in demanding the convocation of a general synod for regulating the organisation of of their church. The main purport of the latest news from Constantinople is, that the Divan has authorised the English fleet to winter at Sinope. As intimated in our publication of yesterday, that Russia has applied to the Shah of Persia for permission to enter with troops into the province of Mogan, bordering on the Russian dominions that Belcochees have attacked Persia on the ii. le of Kerman. and that the army of oc cupation will continue to stay in Greece. All this, if true, is menacing news, and it demands the greatest attention and watchfulness on the part of the British public. An advance of Russian troops in the direction indicated can have the twofold meaning of an approach towards the Koordish districts of Turkey, now in a chronic state of insurrection, or of a preparation to assist Persia in her present difficulties. But the immediate object may be the impression that such a proceeding will make on the minds of the Orientals. The attack of the Belooches on Kerman, i a Place not much more than two hundred miles distant from Shiraz, in an eastern direction, would come so much to the aid of the invasion of  Y. Z.

Lie Rottheru fittito  TVEDAESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1836.  THE DAY'S NEWS. •  A fortnis,ht's later news is to hand from Australia by the arrival of the True Briton in the Channel. The gold fields—which every enquiry proved to be inexhaustible—were yielding a larger produce, and new ones were being opened in all directions. Recent discoveries had been reported both of tin and silver, and a careful exploration was being made of a coal mine, said to have been found on the shores of Port Philip, Quarries of slate and marble had been pointed out, and last, though not least, of all these additions to wealth and comfort of the Colony, a bank of codfish had been sprung, so to speak, in the neighbourhood of King's Island, in Bass's Strait. The first general election in Victoria was going on with great animation. The information that had been received at Melbourne with regard to the Mail contract was not regarded as satisfactory. It was anticipated that the Peninsular and Oriental Company would do all in their power to carry the traffic too far to the Eastward. With her growing population, her increasing resources, Victoria  THE NORTHERN TIMES.---LIVERPOOL, WEDNESDAY.  Shiraz, said to be contemplated by our Govern ment, that we are almost inclined to see more in it than one of those occasional plundering excur sions of the savage children of the desert. Never theless, this intelligence is not the most serious That which relates to the wintering of our squadron at Sinope, and of the army of occupation in Greece is more so. With proceedings like these, the pretended desire to leave the East undisturbed and to provide for its safety by extending the protection of European treaty law to it, it is altogether irreconcilable. Such conduct has the effect of violently tearing up the Treaty of Paris, and should the treaty after this be patched up again, nobody will put great reliance in a document that has been so roughly handled by its originators, The influence of a treaty does not consist in the signatures which may be attached to it, but in the example which those who mace the treaty show to one another of scrupulously observing its contents. In the Netherlands there is a ministerial crisis, caused by an unacceptable budget of the Minister of the Interior. This Minister is a Dr. Simons, who has been in power for five months, and his fault is considered to be a too servile attachment to the King. The votes on his budget were even, but this is considered to be a ministerialdefeat.  THE forthcoming Paris Conference will be well worth recording in the Chaldean style. A slight paraphrase of the original Chaldee Manuscript would bring the entire scene before us in the most truthful and amusing light. There may be no BLACKWOOD there ; but England will have to encounter, in that memorable Council, men whose thoughts are ""as ebony."" We hear already that the diplomatic world is terrified at the gathering of the eagles. Some men are terrified at the flapping of their wings, and for their cries, which are like the voice of an unknown tongue, also their talons, "" which are sharper than any twoedged sword."" And it is foretold that, when a certain great man does see the mighty host make ready for battle, he will not stand, but "" will  "" surely turn back and flee."" Then the great  men and scribes from countries afar off—from the  mighty cities of Vienna, Berlin, Petersburg, Con stantinople, Turin, and divers other lands, w 1  rejoice, and make a loud noise, The flight of "" him which is crafty will be like unto a balm to  the wounds of those whose thoughts are 'as ,‘ ebony.' They shall speak with the freedom o  "" their whole hearts concerning the great men of ,c the North, even the giants and painted folk.'  for which the country is not in the best temper, after the heavy losses and cost we have so recently experienced. We hope, then, that it isnot too late to draw out from the affair altogether, and leave the conferers to submit their proposals to our Government, without exposing us to the risk of being voted down on every question that may be brought under discussion, in a packed and closed chamber. But, if the PALMERSTON Cabinet yield to the threats and entreaties of foreign courts, we repeat, in the words of NORTH, "" Verily, the man which is crafty, shall be "" defeated, and there shall not escape one to tell "" of his overthrow.""  THE Ticket-of-Leave system has failed, not because a large per tentage of the criminals released have not been re committed, but because the public have taken alarm, and appear resolved not to encourage its continuance. It does seem strange, however, that one remarkable fact should have been lost sight of in the discussion, namely, that we must of necessity have at all times a large number of released convicts in society. We convict from 13,000 to 15,000 summarily in this BOrough annually. Some of the offences committed are of the most heinous description. The number tried at the Assizes ranges from 350 to 450 ; of these numbers perhaps 20 per cent are transported ; the remainder are imprisoned for various periods, when they are released, and are mingled once more with the public. Hence we have a constant reflux of convicted crime flowing back upon the country. We have thousands of males and females who have been exposed to contamination both without and within the walls of a prison let loose annually. The total number transported constitutes but a very small proportion of the great bulk of crime thrown back upon the community every year. Our much lauded system of summary punishment is, consequently, nothing more than a gigantic manufactory of ticket-of-leave men and women, and we question if it will be generally admitted that our administration of justice is so perfect as to sanction the conclusion that a sentence of transportation is sufficient evidence of the convict's being an  And he with "" a rotten melon on his head, after "" the fashion of a helmet,"" shall weep bitterly over the sick lion and the fleeing unicorn. There shall, in those days, be no Union Jack wherewithal to bind up the wounds of the deceitful and treacher3us men, who shall have no oak stave as a crutch to lean upon in their tribulation. The false one shall be left desolate at the foot of the ""mount of Proclamations,"" where the rose, and the shamrock, and the thistle grow not. The "" man which is crafty shall surely flee ;"" and they who "" babbleth of many things, and nibbleth "" the shoe-latches of the mighty, one who dark"" eneth counsel with the multiplying cf vain "" words,"" shall not triumph. Nay, not because he "" which is crafty"" fleeth, and the number of the enemy's bands are four. "" And in the first  incorrigible. There is some romance about the legends of our police courts. Matters do not proceed a fuere de .4ragon, as the administrators of justice are not accountable at the year's end, according to the letter of the ancient Morisma. We see, not unfrequently, a person committed for trial, and subsequently transported, for stealing from the person for the first time, and .in another, occurring, perhaps, on the same day, we hear of a notorioualy bad and known character being sentenced to three or six months' imprisonment for stealing a watch or a sum of money from a man's pocket. A savage charged with a murderous assault will probably get a month, with hard labour. A little boy, for stealing a turnip from a garden in Everton or elsewhere will get two months, and be ordered a "" private"" whipping, in addition to his imprisonment. These irregularities—this want of a uniform definition of crime and never varying tariff of pains and penalties renders it quite impossible for the pub "" band four beasts : And in the second four men of war : And in the third six, and in the fourth "" ten. The man which is crafty hath many in "" his host,"" to close the gates against "" the leo"" pard, and the lynx, and the scorpion, and the "" eagle, and the great boar of Lebanon, and the "" griffin. The stork and the hyena, the beagle,  c or the authorities to judge of the magnitude  of the criminal's crimes from the mere fact of his having been transported. Again, it must be  and the mighty creatures which are gathered within the gates"" of the Conference. The words which falleth from the mouth of a backslider are as dross from the crucible of him who worketh in base metals. They speak not the truth, and their acts do not reach that which is untrue. They scoff at all the nations whose thoughts are not ""as ebony."" They love only the "" man which is crafty,"" whom they defeat in the troubled waters of the East. They loathe the tongue of truth and justice, which speaketh out like a voice of thunder.  Were we to follow this style of composition, we fear we should weary the reader ; still, CHRISTOPHER NORTH has given us such a correct key to all gatherings of a public character in describing the movements of his own political friends and rivals, that we could not resist the temptation of giving the Paris Conferers the benefit of a fev; passages of our author's wit and satire. The Conference is most unquestionably a great diplomatic hoax, in which our Envoy will share the fate of "" the man which is "" crafty,"" and it would be difficult to speak of the majority of men who will be opposed to him in more appropriate language, than as men, "" whose thoughts are as ebony."" II the conditions agreed upon, before peace was proclaimed, had been respected we could then understand the propriety of another Congress to suggest modifications in the terms agreed upon. In practice they might be found objectionable on various grounds. But the Treaty of Paris has been treated with the most profound contempt by Russia and Austria. What then have diplomatists to meet about ? No one has ventured to answer this question. We are left, therefore, t.) conclude that it is  remembered that transportation beyond the seas has never been one of perpetual banishment. Our judges never over-strain the law, and the majority—probably 85 per cent—of the persons sent out of the country are removed in early life, and for seven, ten, and fourteen years only ; and as the mortality was never known to have been very severe in our penal settlements, we must have had a large number of return convicts coming back to their old haunts. . We have always been, in fact, a ticket-of-leave creating people on a grand scale; for what is a convict who has undergone the full period of punishment and is set at large either in the colonies or the mother country with a discharge in his pocket but a veritable ticket-of-leave man ? He would be the beau ideal of an incorrigible according to our present notions, if he were caught in the commission of a fresh crime. Mr. Baron ALDERSON related a very discouraging anecdote bearing on this very important subject, which ought to be recorded at this stage of the enquiry. The Learned Judge, some years ago, went over the Milbank Penitentiary with the late Mr. WIIITMORE RUSSELL, a clergyman of considerable eminence, and his Lordship says :—"" After "" I had seen the whole gaol, and observed all "" the means whereby the penitence and reform "" were to be produced, I said to Mr. RUSSELL : "" Pray, Mr. RUSSELL, as I know that you have "" been here fifteen or sixteen years, how many "" persons do you think were really reformed "" during all these years, out of the 700 who "" have been constantly here ? ' Now, what do "" you think was his answer ? Possibly two— "" ' I am sure of one !' This was the experi"" ence of that gentleman in the greatest peniten"" tiary in London, among that class of persons "" of whom we are now speaking having been "" subjected to transportation. But it is absurd "" to talk of this as being reformation."" All this tallies but little with the criminal statistics of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, where nearly all the convicts, sent out "" some "" years ago,"" are now enjoying their liberty, and prospering as honest and industrious people. It may be, however, that Mr. WHITMORE RUSSELL-was the most unsuccessful of criminal reformers. He may have been too zealous—too "" eminent"" for a penitentiary ; for it is quite certain that thousands of convicts who were sent from Milbank some years ago, are w at liberty, either at home or in Australia, and are leading a reformed life. But this question of reformation after conviction, is after all, a minor affair fill thewhich altogether. The duty of the statesman and philanthropist is to strike, both in and out of the Legislature, at the roots of those landcrimes withof home eastas andinfancy,nd condemned  unanswerable. There is nothing to meet about, except to draw off the attention of the people of Western Europe from matters which interest them vastly more. If Russia and Austria meant to abide by the Treaty of Peace, there would be nO need of a meeting of eagles. They would at once do what they have bound themselves to perform. They will not do this, and hence arises the call for a second Conference—a repetition of the shuffling and parleying of last spring. The PALMERSTON Cabinet, however, will take their reign of office, and the honour and consistency cf Great Britain with them to this second council of evasion They must enter it prepared to forego all that is demanded, or retire covered with the humility of defeat. That any circumstance should have been suffered to place the present Government of England in such a position, on the eve of a general election, is much to be lamented. There can be no "" compromise"" brought about which will give satisfaction to all parties, and yielding an a process inch will lead to the surrender of an ell,  slaves. Drunkenness, ignorance, and filth, cause this terrible amount of crime and misery with which we are called upon to deal year after year. We are bound to do the best we can for the reclamation of the fallen ; but it is still a more sacred and paramount duty to rescue the millions we see standing on the brink of destruction. It may not be possible to work out even the temporal salvation of the convicted outcast ; but we can protect and exalt the great mass of the rising youth—we can make them attend school—enforce some species of moral and religious instruction— prepare them for a world which exists by letters, and thrives upon morality and knowledge. Being sentenced to transportation, or the possession of a ticket-of-leave, is no proof that the convict is incorrigible. This is shown every day, in the uncertainties which attend the measuring out of punishment ; and without wishing to oppose the honest conclusions of others, we should like to be informed, on behalf of the ratepaying public, what better system can be adopted, and what we are to do eventually, say half a generation hence, with our criminals, if all classes do not unite to arrest the spread of drunkenness and ignorance, and that frightful amount of crime, which dates from the bad example and neglect of parents ?  LATEST INTELLIGENCE,  FRANCE.  PARIS, TUESDXY EVENING,  Intelligence received here this evening from Sicily informs us that tranquility has been restored.  An attempt had been made to assassinate the King, by a soldier firing his carbine at him.  It is said that the King was slightly wounded. The soldier was immediately killed on the spot.  FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE,  Naples is very considerably agitated, and the authorities are making preparations in the event of an outbreak.  FRAN CE.  PARIS, SATURDAY EVENING. You will find herewith the accounts which the he Moniteur and the Constitutionnal give •of Sicilian insurrection. The foimer paper, es announced to you yesterday it would do, tePre"" seats that the rising had been nut down in dig vicinity of Palermo, but it does not do so in such decided terms as had been expected. The accounts in the Italian papers naturally exalt to the affair; but they are not of such aWe date as those of the Moniteur. The Italia Popolo, a republican journal, goes so far as rtcii say that Mezzojaso, Villafrate, Bomena, Arle,atit Cimina, and many other places had revolted, n,i this journal is not trustworthy. It says that ti.P6 insurgents have adopted the tri-colour national) flag, and that their cry fs l'ltalia !' The Risoramento says that nunlie-. ous arrests , had been made in. the kingdom of Naples, especially at Cilento, 211,,0 province of Salerno. The Opinione speaks oi„ attempt having been made at Naples itself the array to re-establish the Constitution, bu.. this seems to reduce itself to the seizure, the hands of the troops, of some liberal pro mations. e The Italians here express two opinions--se,,,d, that the Sicilian movement is to be lonert;4; inasmuch as it commenced too soon, and colt ho, to the order sof the revolutionary chiefs ; d for reasons which are stated to be good any -sufficient, are anxious that no movement ill finlig, part of Italy should take place before the sPr'h-as The other opinion is that the movement is wnd the commencement of a great national rising, llto that it was intended to give occupation log the troops, whilst the really serious,ris 10 would take place elsewhere. According,o to the holders of this opinion the plan of the chief is to have petty risings all round the coasts -the troops are stationed, but to establish the ahead quarters of the insurrection in the centre of island. a ilea Letters from Naples, to the 2nd, have re-coot .

Russia has sent to the Shah of Persi', requesting him to occupy the territory of Makon.  A young man on the 11th inst. entered the office of John E. Hall, Clerk of the Circuit Court at Gallatin, Illinois, and, without uttering a word, shot Mr. Hall in the back ; as he turned t) look at his assailant, the murderer fired another shot, laying his victim dead. The wretch was arrested, and proved to be the son of James C. Sloo, who is editor of the Shawneetown Illinoisan. The murder was the result of a political controversy in the papers.

While engaged in turning over and examining the goods, she managed to purloin a dress and conceal it beneath her shawl. The draper, however, had seen the theft, and charging her with it, obliged her to relinquish the article, which she did with great confusion. He then placed before her the alternative, either immediately to purchase the dress, or be handed over to the police. The "" lady"" was very glad to adopt the first proposal. THE EARTHQUAKE AT RHODES.—A letter from Rhodes, of the 15th ult., in the Gazette (la Midi, says :—The Turkish steamer Cheh Per, bound for Alexandria, put in here on her way, and landed 500 tents sent by the government for the use of such families as were without shelter from the catastrophe of the 12th. Prayers are coffered up by the poor for the life of the Sultan for his kindness to them since that event. The works for clearing away the ruins, caused by the explosion, are being rapidly proceeded with, and every day articles of furniture, plate, and money, and even human bodies, are discovered.

Such an invasion, undertaken without the legal forms of a solemn declaration of war, setting forth the wrongs suffered and the reparation demanded, is piracy, and any blood shed without such declaration, is murder. Your consent, through your representatives in  Parliament, has never been asked, and jet the expenses are defrayed out of taxes paid by you. Thus you are treated as the basest of slaves, in being made unconscious abettors of piracy and murder. Do not submit to this ; but assemble, and call for the instant meeting of Parliament to vindicate the laws of England, and to free yourselves from blood guiltiness."" LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.—There is a very substantial control over the press, even in England, which has for centuries claimed, and more or less practically enjoyed, "" the liberty of unlicensed printing."" Our press is free with limitations, in harmony with the rest of our free institutions. We may compare it with our free monarchy, for example. Our laws neither tyrannise over it, nor suffer it to tyrannise. It is under restraints, but none that a free people need blush for. They are not the fetters imposed by caprice or despotism, but more resemble the checks imposed by conscience:and integrity on the words and actions of individuals. The press of England is no more above the law than anything else that is English. But the law increases its influence for good by the very penalties it provides for its abuses and extravagances. Actions of libel are the tests of a journalist's veracity, decency. and public spirit. By the just conviction of a libeller the press is purified ; by the acquittal of an earnest and honest writer unjustly charged with the crime, the press gains enormously in character and power. An occasional prosecution of a newspaper is therefore not without its advantages to the public.—Examiner. Two DESTRUCTIVE CONFLAGRATIONS.—Yesterday morning, between six and seven o'clock, a fire, attended with great destruction of property, broke out on the extensive workshops of Messrs. Piper's, builders, Turner's row, Bowcommon. The building in question cmtained the interior fittings of a new church in course of erection at a short distance from the spot. At the time of the disaster several of the workmen were engaged in the place, but the high wind speedily carried the flames round the workshops and they soon mounted high into the air, alarming the eastern portion of the metropolis. The engines of the London Fire Brigade promptly arrived, but there was no chance of saving any portion of the workshops, which, with their valuable contents, and workmen's tools, were totally destroyed. This disaster was caused by the upsetting of a naptha lamp. A second fire broke out this morning, and almost consumed the extensive premises of Mr. John Anderson, broker, 2;50, Evelyn street, Deptford. Several persons who were in their beds asleep could not be aroused for a considerable time, and with difficulty escaped. Cause unknown Contents not insured. We (Times) understand that Mr. Sheepshanks has mum ifi.. cently presented to the nation the whola of his collection of paintings and drawings for the purposes of public instruction in art. Mr. Sheepshanks, disapproving irresponsible management by boards like the trustees of the British Museum and the National Gillery, has male it a condition that the responsibility for his collection must rest with an individual minister—the Minister for Educatijn. Mr Sheepshanks considers that a crowded thoroughfare is not a suitable site for quietly studying works of art, and has stipulated that his collection must be kept in the neighbourhood of its present locality, at Kensington. He is willing that the pictures, &c., should be lent to those provincial towns which provide suitable places to exhibit them. Upon these conditions, which we believe Lord Palmerston has cordially accepted on behalf of the government, Mr. Sheepshanks has signified his readiness to band over immediately the whole of his very fine collection, which is especially rich in the best works of Mulready, Landseer, and Leslie, and contains fine examples of the principal modern British painters in oil. The value of the collection may be estimated at about £60,000.  7 , ",1850

S Excxs. —William Davies, who pleaded guilty to the charge of having on the 28th of August, 1856, at 'Manchester, felomhusly married Ellen Drew, his former wife, Margaret Qumlan, being then alive, was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. James Thomas, who pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary, was sentenced to four years' penal servitude. PoeT OFFICE ROBBERY.--James Ingram was placed at the bar, charged with having stolen a, letter containing a bank bill for £4BO, and eight half notes for £5 each, and also with having received the same, knowing them to have been stolen, The facts on which the charge rests, have beers very recently before the public in our pollee reposes. It appeared that on the 21st of November. S person named Anderson, in the employment of .I:siessre. Pilling and Co., 70, Deansgate, Manchester, put into an envelope, addressed to Mr. Nicholson, leather Boller and currier, Scotland-road, Liverpool, a bank post hilt for £4BO, and the halves of eight £5 notes. This letter he posted in Manchester about half-past six in the evening, and in the ordinary course it should have arrived in Liverpool and been delivered between eight and nine o'clock next morning. The prisoner was engaged that morning in sorting the letters for the 'first delivery, after which he had to carry nut letters, but not those addressed to the cane district as the leder in question. He had then to Return for the second delivery. As it Was very late when he returned some iSitspicion was excited, and he was summoned into the postmaster's office. While being questioned there, he expressed a desire to go to the water-closet. Permission was granted, but a person was set to watch him, and be was seen to transfer something from his waistcoat pocket to his boot. Police were sent for and he was given into custody. when, on being searched, the letter in aoestion was found in his boot. When this was discovered the prisoner said he was not the only guilty person. Before witnesses were called the prisoner, addressing his lordship, said he acknowledged that he was guilty of receiving the letter knowing it to be stolen, but not of stealing it. His Lordship said be should prefer proceeding with the case. The witnesses who previously appeared at the police-office were then called to prove the facts stated. The prisoner made a lengthened statement to the effect that the letters were given him by another carrier to conceal until enquiries should have passed over, and that after taking them he felt some remorse of conscience, and went back to the post office for the purpose either of dropping them there or giving them back to the man who gave them to hint Ilis Coming in having excited suspicion, and caused him to be brought into the postmaster's office, he thought it petter to hide them in his boot until the enquiries were over. Ile added that he could call witnesses to prove his previous good character. His Lordship : I will give you full credit for that—all persons employed by the post-office are persons of good character until they ate found out. The jury found the prisoner guilty. His Lordship sentenced him to fifteen years transportation. GAROTTE ROBSERY.—AIfred Pover, aged nineteen, tailor, was charged with having, on the 29th October, together with two other persons not in custody' violently assaulted John Jones, with intent to rob him. The statement of the prosecutor was, that about ten minutes to seven o'clock, on the evening in question, he was going through Rayner street, Manchester, when a Man caught him round the throat so tightly, as to preterit him from speaking, and another roan came up and struck him on the metith. A third man came up in a Moment afterwards, and called out—"" kick him—punch him"" Prosecutor struggled very hard, and in the struggle the first man was thrust against the doer of a cot'Lese, which was burst through. The light from within was thrown upon the assailants, who seeing the door opened all ran away. Prosecutor cried out, and a man named James Mitchell, living in the street, came to his assistance, and the prisoner was arrested, but the others escaped, The prosecutor positively identified the Prisoner as having been one of his assailants. The Identity of the prisoner was corroborated by a little boy who came out of the cottage, the man named Mitchell, end a policeman. The jury found the prisoner guilty. A coniictierti at the Salford Sessions in August, 181512, for stealing; and sentence of transportation for seven years was proved against the prisoner, who was then tried under the name of John Smith. He had received smaller punishments on several previous occaithis His Lordship He ,appears to have had a good long run of it. I supprise he has had a ticket cf leave. The gaoler said that had not been ascertained. His Lordship : Well; he certainly has not served his seven Years. Ira eseeSsieg sentence his lordship said, the prisoner vas hopeless. All he could do, was to send him away altogether. The sentence of the court was, that he be transported for life. stemma:l GAROTTE ROBBERY.—William Stewart, William Callis, and Ellen Callis, were charged with having, at Blackburn, on the 22nd October, 1856, .violently aesaulted Jonathan Harrison, and stolen from his person £l6 10s, The female pleaded guilty, the male prisoners not guilty. The prosecutor deposed that, on the night in question he was going through Thackburn, when he was attacked, knocked down, and robbed of a canvass bag containing £l6 109 , by two men and a woman. He positively identified the prisoner Stewart as One of the men, but could only speak to the general appearance of the prisoner Calks, In the struggle Which tosA plate between them, prosecutor seized held of Stewart, who, in order to escape, slipped out of his coat and waistcoat, leaving them in prosecutor's hands. The parties succeeded in getting away. The coat and waistcoat were afterwards identified as the property of Stewart. The prisoner Callis was acquitted; Stewart was found guilty. His lordship sentenced Stewart to be transported for tell years, and the female prisoner, Ellen Callis, to he imprisoned for two years. His lordship said he should have sentenced Stewart to lee transported for life if there had been any previous charge against him, as he believed that in Cases such as that the most merciful course was severity. Addressing the woman, he said, that if, after her term of imprisonment she was brought up again, she should be transported for life. GAROTTE ROBBERY AGAlN.—James Marshall, factoryyeorker, was charged with having, on the Ist of Nov., together with a man not in custody, feloniously assaulted John James, with intent to rob him. It appeared that on the night in question the prosecutor, who lives at Ashton-under-Lyne, was in Manchester, and going through Peter street, about eleven o'clock, met two men,one of whom asked him where he was going. He had scarcely time to reply when one ofthem seized him by the throat from behind, and the other began to search hiS pockets. The prosecutor struggled and .shouted, and a stranger came to his aid. The prisoner was arrested by the courage and strength of this man ; but the second assailant escaped. The jury found the Isrisonet guilty. A previous conviction was proved. Toe prisoner clasped hishands together, and passionately cried out for mercy. A sickly-looking woman, standing near the dock, with an infant in her arms, shrieked out—"" Oh, my lord, have mercy—do have mercy on him, his wife, and his two children—l am his wife, and here is his child."" The poor creature had to he removed at length. His Lordship said this was one of a class of ceses he was determined to put down if he coald. He sentenced the prisoner to fifteen years' transportation. His Lordship complimented the man who first came to the prosecutor's aid on his courage and activity, and ordered him a reward of £5. This man, whose name was Capstick, had his clothes torn, and received some hurts in the struggle with the prisoner and the assailant who escaped. .IL', THE GAROTTE OtTRAGE.—John Lloyd, and Wiliram Harrington, were charged with feloniously assaulting and robbing Henry Rothwell. Mr. Cross prosecuted. It appeared that the prosecutor had been in a public house, in Manchester, on the night in question, where the prisoners also were. He treated them to some drink. The prisoner Harrington said he had no money. In going home the prosecutor went a wrong way. Harrington overtook him and they walked on togttber Harrington asked him where he was going, and prosecutor said to Stockport. They turned back together, and on the way went into a public house, where they had some drink. The prisoner Lloyd came in there also. They came nut together, and walked on to a street called Taylor street, where ""Harrington stopped, saying, "" Go on --s-I'll overtake yu. Lloyd walked on with prosecutor, and after they had gone about sixty yards Harrington jumped on prosecutor's back, and knocked him down. Prosecutor endeavoured to cry out, but Harrington caught him round the throat and squeezed him so that he could not cry out. They bothd rifled his pockets of uiculdees.. 4s, some pence, a tobacco box, and some other articles. Nr. Wheeler defended Lloyd. Hp aregton fended. The jury found both prisoners guilty, previous conviction and sentence to seven years transpnrtation was proved against Lloyd in 1853; and a convic tion for theft, with four months imprisonment, against Harrington- His Lordship : I suppose Lloyd has a ticket-of-leave ? Mr. Wheeler said he was not aware of the conviction. His Lordship : It is just about the time they would let him out. Mr. Wheeler called as evidence two respectable tradesmen, who deposed that they had known and employed Lloyd for the last two years, and found him hard-working and industrious. ",1850

Our thanksgiving to day was signalised at two o'clock by the marriage of Senator Douglas of Illinois, to Miss Ada Cutts, of Washington, after which the married couple took the cars for their future residence in Chicago. The bride was accompanied to the altar by several bridesmaids; but the senator, being a widower, went alone. Only a few of his personal friends, including General Shields and Senator Slidell, were present. The marriage ceremony was performed by Father Byrne, of the Roman Catholic Church in the religion of which the bride was educated, at Georgetown nunnery. Senator Douglas himself is not known to have decided leanings towards any religious faith, though some of his friends draw a favourable inference from his recent land donation to a Baptist College In Chicago. In the matter of age and personal beauty there is a wide difference between the bridegroom and the bride. Miss Cutts is tall, elegantly formed, with a sweet oval face, large brown eyes, small Grecian foreheads around which are entwined the heavy braids of her glossy and abundant chestnut hair. On her clear, peachy complexion there is a perpetual war of the roses— the red and the white—each failing to maintain a sole supremacy.

For the gratification of your lady readers the current story as to the way the match was brought about may be worth mentioning. Three months ago the judge—as Mr. Douglas is familiarly called —called at the house of his friend, Senator Bright, who lives just opposite Mr. Cutts', and it so happened that Miss Cutts was there also. Immediately after she left, Senator Bright remarked to his compeer, "" Douglas it's really a shame you're not married. You ought to find a wife at once, and there's the lady for you."" The suggestion seemed to strike Douglas with the force of novelty. Accordingly, procuring an introduction from Mr. Bright to the house over the way, he soon found the recommendation more than borne out by the actual reality, in the personal and mental charms of Miss Cutts. He became a frequent visitor, and the engagement was made in the latter part of the summer, though it did not transpire until a few weeks ago. Miss Cutts may be 22 years of age. She is a contemporary and member of the circle of belles, all now married off, including Adelaide Smith Florence Greenhow, and others, who once formed a great attraction at the receptions and balls of WashingtonHer father, James Madison Cutts, an officer in one of the departments at Washington, is a nephew of Mrs. President Madison and enjoyed a considerable intimacy with his uncle, in whose family he resided. In politics he is an Old-Line Whig, though not long since he volunteered a communication in the Union testifying to the good opinion which President Madison held of Mr. Buchanan. He is a gentlemanly, quiet man, and much liked in Washington society. As for Mr. Douglas, everybody ought to be familiar with his antecedents and appearanceIn point of years he has decidedly the advantage of his bride, being about twice as old. In person he is short and stocky, a short of truncated giant, whence his well known designation. He has a red, somewhat rowdyish face, large features, the nose being rather retrousse, but still with an expression indicating rather a rude, unrefined nature, and an imperious energy, than any settled meanness or malignity of disposition. In truth, I think him a very good natured, pleasant man, individually. He is perfectly willing after abusing, or being abused, in the most violent manner, to extend the right hand of fellowship to his enemy, though his political hostility is unrelenting. He is said to be worth at least 100,000 dollars, the result of fortunate speculation in Chicago lots, aside from the property, mostly in Louisiana plantations. left for his two little boys by his first wife. While at Washington he lives in a handsome, old-fashioned stuccoed house in the outskirts of the city, together with a sister, who, with her husband, superintends his domestic affairs. Whether Mr. Douglas or his fair bride ever have the fortune to chance their residence and dispense the hospitality of the White-horse or not, I wish them both a pleasant honeymoon and a prosperous and unclouded married life.— Washington Evening Post.

Connor, the four youths charged with stealing the ham (reported in our paper cf yesterday), were brought up on remand, Another flitch of the bacon had been found, but there was no further evidence given at present. Mr. Bluck appeared for the prisoner Thomas Finnegan, and contended that the evi fence was not sufficient to detain that prisoner, and urged his discharge. his worship held the same opinion, and discharged the prisoner. Soon after Mr. Black entered the court and said the bo) had been again arrested by the police. He complained of this as an i ifringcment of justice. It was intimated to Mr. Blink that the wrest was made on another charge. AN APPARITION.—James Fletcher, a youth about 18 years of age, was cba-ged under the following circumstances. Mr. Hughes appeared for the prosecution, and I Mr. Black defended. It appeared that a Mrs. Wignall. who keeps a confectioners shop in Byrom street, had, for the last six months, missed a variety of things from the shop, ' and at last, from something that transpired, a watch was kept on the place, and early on Monday morning the prisoner was found in the shop,having got into it out of the cellar,by starting a board ; his father kept a gas-fitting shop in the cellar. 'The prisoner was remanded. DOING THE OLD SOLDIER Three ill looking fellows named William Fletcher, George Moffett, and Henry Simpson,described as discharged soldiers,were charged with having stolen £6 from a soldier named Charles Skirrett The complainant said he met the prisoners in Lime street when he took them to Griffith's vaults and treated them, and the return they made, in gratitude, was to rob him. The prisoners were remanded.

COUNTY COURT.-YESTERDAY.  BEFORE J. POLLnli, E.SQ , THE JUDGE. CAUTION TO HOTEL WAITERS.—A case of considerable importance not only to waiters at hotels, but hotel keepers themselves, came on for hearing in the above court yesterday. In this case, Arthur Rows, a waiter, was the plaintiff, and Mr. Augustus Speiser, the proprietor of the Victoria Hotel, St. John's lane, near the St. George's Hall, was the defendant. The claim was for LI 17s. 6d., for wages. Mr. Hime, solicitor, appeared for the defendant. On the case being called on, the plaintiff said he was hired by Mr. Speiser, and the wages was to be 153. a week with perquisites. He had been there ten weeks, and on Thursday, the 16th of October, he was discharged ; and having been paid on the preceding Saturday, he claimed the wages for ten days, including a week's notice and a week's salary held in hand, a custom pursued at the hotel, in order to prevent the waiters having without notice. Cross examined by Mr. Hime : Mr. Speiesr and the manager, Mr. Ibbersly, were present when he was engaged. At that time he was not told that there were not any perquisites, He did hoar something said about not being allowed to ask for money, but that he might have what was given to him. Ho recollected a gentleman dining there on the Tnursday. He did not ask him for any money, but he told him he had not left him anything lately. Before that, he had frequently given him something. When ho asked the gentleman for something, he said that he was not entitled to anything, because waiters were charged in the bill. The manager, and Mr. Speiser, soon after came up in a passion, and the former told him to leave the house immediately, and after that Mr. Speiser told him that his services would not be required after that night. He then took off his white collar and left the house. The next day he called and demanded his wages. 2s 6.1 was tendered hint, but that he refused to accept. The Court : How came you to ask for anything of a gentleman, when you knew that attendance was put in the bill ? The Waiter : I thought I was entitled to it. A young female was called, but her evidence was not material to the case. Mr. Hime addressed the court for the defendant. He said that he should he able to prove that the plaintiff, at the time he was engaged, was distinctly and emphatically told that he was on no account to est for money. That the rules of the house was, that all attendance was charged for. The case was of great importance to the defendant, as by an infringement of such rules by a waiter, great injury might be done. Ho contended that the plaintiff was, in reality, only entitled to fifteen shillings, although ho had been offered LI 23 6d. He called Mrs. Speiser, who stated, at the time she engaged the waiter, she was very particular in telling him that he was never to ask for any money, but if persons liked to give it him he might have it. She would most positively swear that she told him so three times over. Mr. Ibbersley, the manager, corroborated the statement as to the agreement, and said, that on the day the plaintiff was discharged, a gentleman had told him that he had been insulted, while at his dinner, by being asked for money by the waiter, but that he had given him such an answer that ho did not think he would do it again. He then went on to say that the waiter had behaved very impertinent, and had left the house, The Court : When did you ask the gentleman for money? Was it as he was leaving or not ? Waiter While he was getting his dinner. Tne Court : I shall give you a verdict for only fifteen shillings. Your conduct was very improper in asking for money, when you knew it was against the rule of the hotel, particularly in being so impertinent as to do so when the gentlemen was getting his dinner. A verdict was then returned for the plaintiff for fifteen shillings, without costs.  Tne New NATIONAL GALLERY.—We understand that a royal commission will shortly be issued, appointing Lord Broughton, the Dean of St. Paul's, Mr. R. Ford, Mr. Faraday, Mr. Cockerell, R. A , and Mr. Gen. Richmond, to enquire into and determine the site of the new National Gallery, and to report on the desirableness of combining with it the Fine Art and Archeaological collections of the British Museum. THE NEW JOINT STOCK COMPANIES A T.—The rumber of companies incorporated under the new act is 626, of which 221 are with limited liability, and 305 unlimited. The unlimited companies are generally re-registrali ins of previously existing companies. All companies, except banking and insurance companies, were required to be registered by the 3rd Ult. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MESSRS. MARE AND CO , BLACKWALL—Yesterday, Messrs. Fuller and Co., in conjunction with Messrs. Charles Pullen and Son, auctioneers, Fore-st., by direction of the assignees of Mr. C. S. Mare, commenced the sale of the property of the bankrupt, which is situated on the Middlesex side of the estate, and which occupies an area on both sides of Bow Creek, of upwards of fourteen acres. For severel weeks past the auctioneers have been engaged in selling the property on the east, or Essex side, and which, it is believed, rea'ised about £25,000. SERIOUS INUNDATION_ AT CARLISLE.—.O Wing to the very heavy rains which have fallen in thisueighbourheod during Saturday and Sunday, the lower parts of the city have become flooded, and a large number of the houses are from two to three feet deep with water. Much damage to property is apprehended, and a considerable quantity of stock has been carried away from the banks of the Eden, the Caldew, and the Petteril. Upon those of the Caldew, the Corporation Bay, situate about a quarter of a mile above the city, has been completely washed down. The Eden. from Rickerby to the viaduct of the Caledonian railway, a distance ( f about a mile, is one complete sheet of water, the Swifts, the two Sauceries, and all the adjacent fields being inundated. WRECK OF THE SHIP CLAREND)4.—The week of the above vessel has been reported at Lloyn's. The following details are given in a letter dated Whitehaven, DCc. 6 : "" The ship Clarendon, Captain Noose, from Miramichi for Liverpool, with a cargo of timber, &c., went on shore close to Rednes Point, about a mile N.E. i of this port, this afternoon, about 4.30. The Clarendon s a new ship, of about SOO tons, and she had Leen in Westport a few days, and a powerful steamer was sent from Liverpool for the purpose of towing her to the latter port. it appears from the report of the master of the steamer that during the passage the tow-rope had broken three times, and this morning, when off the Black Combe, it again broke for the fourth time, and the sea being so heavy he was not able to get it again. It was blowing strong from the south-west when the ship went on shore, and the sea being very heavy, sixteen of the crew were taken on shore in the life-boat. The master refused to leave the ship, and four of the crew were left on board with him , but if she keeps together they will be able to get on shore at low water. It is probable the Clarendon will become a total wreck."" ",1850

An active demand for Money prevails in London and Liverpool, and the minimum quotation is in almost all instances demanded. There is, there fore, no expectation of any further immediate alteration in the official rate, as the arrangement of the quarterly and. annual accounts, as well as the revenue payments, will all assist in maintaining a full enquiry. This morning the market for the English Funds opened at the reduced values current yesterday afternoon, when, owing to the heaviness of the French Bourse, and one or two other minor circumstances. Consols were rather weaker. Besides a few sales by parties who, being frightened by the pause in the upward movement, were induced to realise their profits, there have been some-.73ear operations, but the market shows considerable strength. Consols have been 9321 and 031-1 for the Bth January. A special transfer is reported at 94:-, inclusive of the dividend.

The amount of gold brought by the True Briton, from Melbourne, is as much as 90,000 ounces, worth about 360,0001. The dates by this vessel extend to the 12th of September. There has been very little business transacted in railway shares this morning, and the fluctuations in prices have not been more than about to 3, per cent. Caledonian, Lancashire and Yorkshire, Brighton, Brighton, North-Western, South-Western, and Midland were about ss. bettor; but Great Northern, Great Western, North-Eastern Berwick, and South Eastern declined 5s to 10s, and Chester and Holyhead V. The French lines are also at rather depressed prices. Paris and Lyons declined about 5s to 7s lid, and LombardoNeuetian, Dutch nuts Muse auout as. Grand Trunk of Canada and Great Western of Canada were each about 5s lower, and Seinde are quoted 7 Some surprise was occasioned yesterday afternoon by.the receipt of telegraphic information to the effectlhat the Bank of Amsterdam had raised the rate of discount from sto 571 per cent. This measure would have excited little attention if most of the other continental money markets were not tending in an opposite direction At the same time, however, 5! per cent for money in Holland is a very unusual quotation for discounts, and, although the advance is attributed to the disturb anee caused by the silver speculation, it may be found that the authorities also had in view the impending Russian Loan, which, if it cannot be obtained in France or England, will perhaps be introduced elsewhere:  • The agents of the Peruvian government in New York announce, with reference to the Peruvian debt issued in favour of New Granada and Equador, that the sum appropriated to the redemption fund on the sth Sept. last was 27,149 dols The outstanding debt is now reduced to 2,481,600 dols, or about 496,0001 sterling. The proprietors of the Grand Trunk Railway have issued a circular in which the shareholders are invited to subscribe for preferential six per cent bonds to the amount of two millions sterling. The holders of these bonds are to have priority over the first lien of the province; and the proceeds, which are to be deposited, in the first instance, in the hands of the financial agents of the Canadian government in London, are to be handed over to the company upon proof being given to the government respecting the progress of the works. One of these works is the Victoi is bridge. The directors hint that the immediatesubscribing of this capital will materially strengthen their position in urging upon the Canadian government a modification of the relief act. A deposit of 10 per cent is to be paid on the new preferential bonds by the 19th instant. The prospectus of the Dagenham Dock Company is issued. This company has been incorporated by act of parliament for the purpose of providing additional dock accommodation in the Thames. The new docks are to be situated on the north side of the river, and, it is mentioned, will comprise a total area of 142 acres, inclusive of warehouses, cattle pens, &c. The north side of the docks will be bounded by the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway. A considerable amount of business is apparently expected from the coal trade. The capital is fixed at 90,0001., in 101. shares, and the first call is to be 21. The deposit is fixed at 10s. per share. Messrs Browne, Hunter, and Co.'s circular of this date, in relation to the movements in East Indian produce, says :  During the past fortnight there has been greater confidence manifested in monetary matters, which is ascribed to the timely arrivals of gold from Australia, part of which has remained in the Bank coffers, thereby augmenting slightly its stock of bullion. The directors of the Bank of England reduced on the 4th inst. their rate of discount -1; per cent., the minimum rate being now 6i per cent., and although but a trifling concession, the movement is in the right direction, and is likely to impart a better feeling in mercantile affairs. The produce markets have been active, prices well supported, and in some instances an upward tendency is apparent. The letters per the South American Mail were delivered here this morning. At Pernambuco we learn that there was a large business doing in sugar and cotton, and prices of both articles had materially advanced. The latter being a full id. per lb. higher than on the departure of the former mail. At Bahia, prices were steady, in fact rather on the decline. At Rio Janeiro, the exchange market was firm at 28Z. to 27; The sales in coffee had been rather extensive, amounting to 249,700 bags in the month, at very full rates. By the True Briton we have Melbourne advices to the 12th of September. This vessel brings some eighty or ninety thousand ounces of gold, valued at £350,000. At Melbourne there was a fair demand for gold, and this article was quoted at 755. 6d. to 765. per ounce. The arrival of gold per escort had kept up to their average, altho some allowance might be made for the licence of general election times at the diggings. Quartz crushing operations were being extended, and no doubt could exist of the benefits of such a system. The escort returns for the fortnight ending September 6, gave a total of 1,804,041 oz, ",1850

On Monday afternoon, a most serious explosion of gas took place on the premises of Mr. Geerge Colk, chemist and druggist, No. 29, Fleet street. City, nearly opposite the church of St. Dunstan's in the West, resulting in the destruction of a considerable amount of the extensive stock, in addition to the damage to the premises, but, fortunately, unattended with injuries of a serious nature to any person, notvvithstandingsthe fact that a young man, who fills the office of assistant to Mr. Colk, was seriously burnt about the hea i and flee. It appeared that on Friday and Saturday last, the gas in Mr. Colk's shop burnt black and smoky, and did not give a brilliant light, i. oOnocquotac. 141,11 C.,11, wrote to the company, requesting that a man might be sent to see what was the matter with the pipes. Accordingly the gas company directed one of their servants to attend on Monday morning. The person in .question left Mr. Colk's premises shortly after twelve o'clock, having previously investigated the cause of the defect. About one o'clock the assistant smelt gas, and in order to ascertain from whence it proceeded, at once struck a light, and placed it at one end of a glass case in the front window, through which the gas pipe passed. While he was doing so the other end of the case was blown out with great force, and a sheet of flame rushed round the shop, bringing down nearly 200 bottles (some of them containing very valuable drugs) ha its conrse, hurling them on to the floor and smashing them into pieces. Passing to the end of the shop the flames broke through some plate glass windows in the door of a lobby, into which it entered, and from there through other glass windows into the back surgery. The shop front was greatly damaged, and most of the windows and bottles, containing acids, perfumes, &c., which were deposited therein, were blown out into Fleet street. The young man was severely burnt upon the head and face, but no dangerous results are anticipated. It is supposed the gas had escaped from the pipe during the time the gasman was cleaning it. The damage done to the premises and stock is very considerable.  The Board of School Directors in the city of St. Louis have passed the following resolution : "" That henceforth no teacher shall be allowed to inflict blows on the head in any manner ; that the use of the rattan, or like instrument upon the hand, is prohibited e and that bruising or maiming the hand, or any other part of the body, will not be tolerated ; and this board wish it distinctly understood that, in accord. ance with powers reserved in their rules, they will consider departure from such restrictions good cause fa immediate discharge from the service of this board."" DETERMINED SUICIDE OF A GENTLEMAN.—Yesterday information was received by the police, of a determined suicide by a gentleman, in Highgate Cemetery, who shot himself through the head with a pistol. The body, on being discovered, was removed to the Angel Tavern. It is that of a man about 40, clad in a fashionable suit of black, and loose over coat ; on one of his fingers was a handsome gold signet ring, and in his pocket a sum of money, two letters (sealed), one addressed to Miss Parrott, and the other to Miss Partridge, and other documents, leading to the belief that the deceasei waa an officer holding a high position in the army. TILE UNITED STATES AND NEW GRANADA.—A Washington letter says :—"" The Hon. Isaac E Morse, formerly member of Congress for Louisiana, and who has also held the post of attorney-general of that state, is expected here in a day or two, when he will receive the appointmont of envoy extraordinary to New Granada. His duty there will be to endeavour to effect an arrangement with the New Granadian government in reference to the claims of our citizens against that government, arioing out of tho sacra at Panama in April last, and also as to security from a repetition of such outrages. A number of cabinet meetings have been held in regrard to this matter, but as yet no definite conclusion has been arrived at. The question is a very delicate and difficult one, and one with which the administration find it hard to deal."" LANDSLIP NEAR HALIFAX.—OR Sunday night, SOOT] after eleven o'clock, a landslip occurred at Stump Cross, about a mile from Halifax. A considerable quantity of water had collected in the hollows on the Northowram hill' side, in consequence of the recent thaw and the heavy showers of rain which fell during Saturday and Sunday ; and in the afternoon of the latter day the water was observed springing up in a column about as thick as a man's arm. at a short distance below one of the ponds. This had no effect upon the residents, except to excite the curiosity of some ; but at night, when many of them had retired to rest, they were greatly alarmed by a rumbling noise, which was followed by the falling of thousands of tons of earth from the upper to the lower part of the hill, bringing with it large trees and fences, and almost completely blocking up the carriage way below. Fortunately no one was hurt, but two or three of the inhabitants narrowly escaped with their lives, and many were so teraified that they sat up the greater part of the night. INSURANCE ON GRAIN.—During two years past, of all vessels that have gone from here to European ports, loaded with grain in bulk, but one has been lost, and that in a gale of last January, and not from being overloaded. Over twelve millions of bushels of grain have been sent in this manner, and only nine thousand lost. Perhaps this great exemption fr m loss may be fairly attributed to the appointment of an inspector, whose duty it is to examine every vessel that seeks insurance, and without his certificate that she is properly loaded, the vessel cannot be accepted by the underwriters. Of all the vessels thus examined and certified, but one has been lost, as before mentioned. This wonderful success shows that accidents at sea are usually the result of negligence on the part of owners or officers, and that the underwriters make a great saving in exercising vigilance in the loading of vessels insured.—New York Observer. [As our readers are probably aware, this plan is followed out by the Liverpool Underwriters, who have no less than four surveyors in their employ.] ",1850
