D. McKellar of Tennessee, at a\\nmeeting in the interest of equal suffrage at the courthouse last night (De\\ncember 16). At the conclusion of the meeting a resolution, offered by\\nMrs. W. Hayes Brown, Jefferson, calling upon the Senator and members\\nof the Legislature of this county to vote for the ratification of the Fed\\neral Suffrage Amendment, was unanimously passed.\\nThe meeting was presided over by Chief Judge Hammond Urner,\\nwho, in a few but stirring remarks, stated that the suffrage question was\\na problem for immediate solution. The Federal amendment, he said,\\nhas been recommended by Congress and adopted by 22 sovereign States,\\nincluding the great State of New York, and “I cannot see why the Mary\\nland Legislature should not feel as free to adopt it as the New York\\nLegislature.” It is not a political question, he added, as both parties\\nhave endorsed it. He said he was not in favor of woman’s suffrage until\\nthe past few years, but was now thoroughly in favor of it. He stated\\nthat he did not think that the sex to which he belongs had made such a\\nbrilliant success in the management of affairs as not to accept assistance\\navailable.\\nMiss Younger said that Federal suffrage was a new and active move\\nment but seven years old. She then gave a history of the original move\\nment for woman’s suffrage dating back 40 years ago. The first great\\ndemonstration in the interest of the new movement, she said, took place\\nsix years ago when a large body of women marched in a parade in Wash\\nington the day before the inauguration of President Wilson. She gave\\na very interesting account of the difficulties in launching the early move\\nment and later in securing the endorsement of President Wilson for suf\\nfrage. She touched upon the activities of the White House “pickets,”\\nand told of the hard and constant work that was required to place the\\nsuffrage issue before Congress. Finally when Congress had passed the\\nFederal Amendment Act, four years more of work was required until\\nthe Senate voted favorably. She said it cost $50,000 to get the votes of\\nnine United States Senators for suffrage. In conclusion she said equal\\nsuffrage is assured and that Maryland is one of the States whose Legis\\nlature will vote to ratify the amendment. If Maryland fails, we have\\nthree other States to fall back on to support the amendment. The only\\nquestion, she said, is whether men of Maryland will vote for suffrage or\\nhave it voted upon them by other States.\\nSenator McKellar said it was remarkable that anyone should come\\nto this city in the interest of woman’s suffrage. Frederick, he said, owes\\nits greatest fame to a woman, and every citizen should be unanimous in\\nextending equal rights. He told of his conversion to woman’s suffrage,\\nand said without it the best half of the country’s population have no\\nvoice in public affairs. The Government will be better, politics cleaner\\nand the people happier, he said, when women vote, because the best\\nSenator Curtis, Republican Whip of the U. S. Senate, Urges Ratification\\n“The addition of three more Republican States to the list which have already ratified is a fact of which the Republican Party can\\nwell be proud. There are few things which I would rather have go down in history to the credit of the Republicans than THE\\nENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY.”\\nMr. Will Hays, National Republican Chairman, Urges Ratification\\nTelegram Sent to Maine to Halbert P. Gardiner\\n“Just have your telegram advising that both Senators and most of the leaders there favor ratification of Suffrage Amendment by\\nLegislature immediately, and asking my opinion. National Committee at its meeting in January by unanimous vote urged all State\\nLegislatures to ratify amendment at first possible time. I CONCUR IN THIS RESOLUTION and in your opinion, and hope that\\nMaine WILL RATIFY.”\\nRepublican Party Supported Suffrage in Congress\\nRepublicans in United States House of Representatives voted for suffrage 203 to 35 —85 per cent, of Republican voting strength.\\n(May, 1919.)\\nRepublicans in United States Senate voted for suffrage 40 to 9 —Bl per cent, of Republican voting strength. (June, 1919.)\\nMention the Maryland Suffrage New« When Patronizing Our Advertisers.\\nmen will then be chosen for office in every community. The most bit\\nter election in the history of Memphis, Tenn., he stated, was won by\\nwomen who elected officials that gave the city the best administration it\\never had. Other large cities in Tennessee followed suit, and Frederick\\nwill do the same, he said, when women vote. He characterized woman’s\\nsuffrage as a great forward movement that will continue to forge ahead.\\nThis great movement, he said, is going to be accomplished, as revolutions\\ndo not go backward. “Regardless of what Maryland does, women are\\ngoing to vote —because it is right. No other Federal amendment has\\never gone ahead so rapidly. No State that has ever adopted equal suf\\nfrage will take it back. Woman’s suffrage and prohibition go hand in\\nhand for the purity and uplift of the State.” He paid a high tribute to\\nthe patriotism of women and to the part they took in the great war.\\nThere is not a woman who speaks the English language, he said, who is\\nnot profoundly patriotic.\\nAt the conclusion of his address Mrs. Brown introduced the resolu\\ntion requesting the local representatives in the Legislature to vote in favor\\nof the amendment, which was unanimously carried.\\nBefore the resolution was voted upon Senator-elect Dr. Charles F.\\nGoodell stated that the suffrage advocates had a good field for mission\\nary work in this county. He said while he had a growing belief in\\nwoman’s suffrage, he would like to see some enthusiasm in the city and\\ncounty and also in the State in regard to the ratification of the amend\\nment. He added that he had received about 20 letters from women in\\nBaltimore and three or four from women of this city requesting him to\\nvote for woman suffrage. He said he desired to represent the sentiment\\nof the people of this county in the Senate, and intimated that a wider\\nsentiment than expressed at the meeting should be forthcoming upon mat\\nters that will come up before the legislative body of which he is a mem\\nber. He stated that he had gained information from the excellent ad\\ndresses and he added he regretted that an audience was not present that\\nwould have packed the courtroom. Miss Alice Paul of Washington, one\\nof the foremost suffrage workers in the country and who gained notoriety\\nas a White House “picket,” was among the audience.\\nThe resolution passed at the meeting was as follows:\\nWhereas the Federal Suffrage Amendment has passed the Congress\\nof the United States and has been ratified by Legislatures of 22 States;\\nand\\nWhereas the Legislature of Maryland meets in January, 1920, when\\nit will have an opportunity to place this State in the list of 36 States to\\nratify said amendment; therefore be it\\nResolved, That it is the sense of this meeting held in the courthouse\\nat Frederick, Md., on December 16, that the members of the General\\nAssembly from Frederick county be requested to vote in favor of the\\nSusan B. Anthony Amendment at the ensuing term of said General\\nAssembly.',\n",

Men who had pretended to be\\nreally free, and who have kept their hall and chain hidden under a sleek\\nexterior, were hurled with revolting speed from the suffrage to the anti\\nsuffrage camp in the interim between the first and second vote on the\\nsuffrage measure. On the first vote the suffragists mustered 45 votes in\\nthe affirmative with 43 in the negative; on the second vote there were\\nonly 34 in the affirmative and 60 in the negative. Two Delegates ex\\nplained that they were voting for the measure merely because they\\nobjected to the general proposition of tabling. Almost all of the others\\nwere bona-fide suffrage votes. It was a shocking and a melancholy thing\\nto see citizens of our supposedly free country, and voters at that, meanly\\ncringe at the crack of the whip and fall back into line. Mr. James McC.\\nTrippe, who before election pledged himself in the presence of witnesses\\nto support the suffrage measure, first packed the Committee on Consti\\ntutional Amendments with anti-suffragists, and then proceeded to break\\nhis word by voting against the hill. It may be said to his credit that he\\nvoted for the bill on the first vote. The spirit was probably willing, but\\nthe flesh was weak. It is to be hoped that the voters in the Third District\\nwill remember that a man who breaks his word to women is not a man to\\nbe trusted.\\nMr. Cummings of Montgomery county also repudiated his pledge, but,\\nknowing the general character of the man, this was more or less to be\\nanticipated.\\nWhen such prominent members of the Democratic party deliberately\\nproceed to break their pledges, one may well question the quality of the\\ntimber that the Democratic platform itself is built of.\\nMR. POSEY AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\\nEven after the Republican party adopted the Woman Suffrage Plank\\nlast summer and went on record as favoring the submission of the, ques\\ntion of woman suffrage to the voters, skeptical wiseacres in the suffrage\\nranks shook their heads doubtfully and voted the Democratic ticket.\\n“The Republicans are merely trying to catch votes,’’ they said. “When\\nthe time comes the Republican members will break their pledge glibly and\\nvote against the suffrage amendment.\\nNever again will these doubting Thomases among the suffragists be\\nable to speak so scornfully of the Republican party, for the splendid\\nstand which Mr. Posey took on the floor of the House when the vote on\\nthe bill was taken, sweeps all doubts as to the party’s honor into oblivion.\\nMr. Posey is personally opposed to the principles of woman suffrage.\\nHe believes, however, that the voters have the right to rule, and above all\\nhe believes that a party which has pledged itself to any given measure is\\nin honor bound to support that measure. The Republicans of the State\\nmay well he grateful that the members of the House chose Mr. Posey as\\nthe Republican floor leader at this session. Under his guidance the\\nRepublicans have out-Democrated the Democrats in the principles of\\nDemocracy, and have proven once and for all that the honor of their party\\nis above reproach.\\nHELP THE CAUSE. —Mention the Maryland Suffrage News When Patronizing Our Advertisers.\\nMARYLAND SUFFRAGE NEWS\\nTHE TEST OF COURAGE\\nIt is an easy thing to march serenely on to victory. The test of cour\\nage comes when transient defeat bars the pathway. Only in face of dis\\naster can the true courage of the individual be measured. Not to lose\\nheart in disaster, not to relax the ultimate effort even when hope seems to\\nhave perished, is to prove one’s self a true hero.\\nAn English economist once gave as his description of the perfect wife,\\n“A woman serene, who can sing in a boat.” The definition is admirably\\nsuited to the perfect suffragist. What is needed to insure success for any\\nreform measure is adherents “who can sing in a boat,” even when the boat\\nis sinking.\\nIF FACTS ARE WANTED\\nThere ought really to be no question as to the results of woman suf\\nfrage in the States that have adopted it. Of course, States like California,\\nin which the franchise has been so receilt an acquisition, time sufficient for\\na real test has not yet elapsed; but in States like Wyoming and Colorado,\\nwhere the system has been tried for upwards of twenty years, there\\nought, one would think, to be fto difficulty to ascertain whether the new\\nrights conferred upon women have made conditions better on the one\\nhand and done no harm on the other.\\nAnd yet it seems to be almost impossible at this distance to get the\\nevidence that all will accept as to the situation. The suffrage people have\\nsent investigators, and so have the anti-suffragists, and each set have\\nseemed to find what they went for ; and their reports have been mutually\\ndiscredited, and neither party has been convinced.\\nAt last we have been furnished with evidence that can hardly be mis\\nunderstood or misrepresented. A Congressman from Colorado, and a\\nDemocrat at that, the Hon. Edward Keating, appeared before an audi\\nence in the Academy of Music last Sunday and made many statements as\\nto conditions in that State, proving beyond reasonable doubt that woman\\nsuffrage in Colorado, and presumably in the other franchise States, is a\\ngreat success. He offered evidence to prove that the respect shown to\\nwoman has increased, not diminished; that she cares for her family as\\nwell as do her Eastern sisters ; that laws and social conditions have been\\nimproved; that the character of those fvho seek office is higher, and that\\nthe arguments against woman suffrage, so familiar to us all, have been\\ndisproved by the experience in Colorado, and are there forgotten in the\\nbeauty and value of the new order of things.\\nThe moderation of Mr. Keating's statements made them all the\\nstronger, and yet throughout his address one could note the pride of the\\nman in representing a State that had long ago solved the problem that we\\nEastern people, in our blindness and lack of wisdom, are feebly struggling\\nover.\\nLet no one say hereafter that woman suffrage in the West is anything\\nbut a glorious success. O, Maryland, my Maryland ! O. E. J.\\nOYSTERS VS. WOMEN\\nEven at the climax of the woman suffrage campaign in Maryland it\\nmust be admitted that the oyster, not the woman, occupied the center of\\nthe stage. While the woman suffrage bill hung in the balance, news of\\nits status in the daily press had to give way to the oyster industry. Col\\numn upon column of outside page space was devoted to the oyster; a pos\\nsible fragment of an inside column devoted to the woman suffrage bill.\\nSuch is the way of the world under a male electorate. Every interest cen\\nters on business propositions; women, morality and reform of community\\nhfe are all put under cover and sidetracked. When women vote the\\noyster will be equally well protected; the woman more so.\\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE SECOND DISTRICT\\nOf all the four districts in Baltimore city the only one which carried\\nthe day for suffrage was the Second Legislative District. Four members\\nof the House in the Second District, Messrs. Hall, Wilkinson, Mahool\\nand Delaney, voted in favor of the suffrage amendment. Mrs. S. Johnson\\nPoe, President of the Just Government League of the Second District, is\\nto be sincerely congratulated on the splendid record of the Second\\nDistrict.\\nPROOF OF MARYLAND’S PROGRESS\\nAt the last session of the Legislature (1912) the State-wide Woman\\nSuffrage Amendment received 22 votes in the House, the bill containing\\nan educational qualification receiving only 18. At this session of the\\nLegislature 45 votes were cast in favor of the measure on the first count\\nand 34 on the final count. This indicates beyond any doubt the wonder\\nful strides the movement has made in Maryland within the past two years.\\nIn spite of the fact that the Legislature is largely Democratic, nearly\\ntwice as many votes were cast in favor of the suffrage bill as at the\\nprevious session.\\n[February 21, 1914.]\",\n",

In 1915, also, Norwegian\\nwomen pushed forward the most advanced laws for the protection of\\nillegitimate children that are in force in any country. They have also\\ngained equal chances and equal pay with men in State offices.\\n“I am in favor of the political as well as the social equality of the\\nwomen of our race. As a woman directs the smallest government in the\\nworld —the home—the cornerstone of our civilization itself, so she should\\nhave equal claim to and share in shaping and controlling the destinies of\\nthe bigger and correlated governments among men. The doctrine that\\nno one shall be governed without the consent of the governed has its force\\neven here.”—Judge Freschi, City Magistrate of New York City.\\n“It is no longer denied that woman suffrage will shortly be established\\nthroughout the United States; the evidence from the States in which\\nwomen have voted goes to prove that with the ballot women are more\\nfairly treated under the law, the working woman is better protected and\\nsocial and moral improvement is accelerated.”—Thomas A. Edison.\\n“I would rather have the help of one earnest woman in campaigning\\nfor the children than that of a whole regiment of judicious, experienced\\nmen.”—Jacob Riis.\\nSUFFRAGE CHRISTMAS SALE\\nDecember 7—B 9\\n817 N Charles St\\nSave your Christmas Shopping for the Suf>\\nfrage Sale and you will please your friends and\\nhelp suffrage at the same time.\\n227\",\n",

       "   'ocr_eng': \"70\\nCITY LEGISLATORS’\\nViews on Woman Suffrage\\nSENATOR WILLIAM OGDEN,\\nOF BALTIMORE CITY\\nSays: “I draw your attention to the fact that there is a place where men\\nshall talk real politics, and it is in the home. They should there find in their\\nwives not an unresponsive, uninterested mind because not charged with re\\nsponsibility. Women are like men—they do not charge themselves with re\\nsponsibilities that are not placed upon them. They are not necessarily inter\\nested in matters that they are not responsible for. The men that do not want\\nto vote —it is best for the community that they do not vote; and the women\\nwho do not want to vote —it is best for the community that they do not vote.\\nBut the men who want to vote are the men who control the world, and the\\nwomen who want to vote should be associated with them.”\\nDELEGATE ROBERT E. LEE,\\nOF BALTIMORE CITY\\nSays: “Give the right to the men of Maryland to say whether or not they\\nwant the women to vote, and I have come to the conclusion that, inasmuch\\nas there is no other way that this can be accomplished except by a consti\\ntutional amendment, it is only fair that we should do our part and put this\\nbefore the men of Maryland.”\\nDELEGATE LLOYD WILKINSON,\\nOF BALTIMORE CITY\\nSays: “There are thousands of women engaged in business, thousands of\\nwomen who have property upon which they have to pay taxes, thousands not\\nrepresented by any man, and they are saying to you in the loudest tones: ‘We\\nought to have the right to vote for our representatives in the Legislature. Men\\ngo there and make laws under which we are governed, and we have no say as\\nto those men.’ I say that if nine-tenths of the other women say they don’t\\nwant to vote, that is no reason why the other tenth should not have the right\\nto vote if they wish for it.”\\nDELEGATE EMMERT WHITE,\\nOF BALTIMORE CITY\\nSays: “I don’t see how anyone who really believes in the principles of\\ndemocracy can reject the principles of woman suffrage. I have no patience\\nwith these ladies who preach the doctrine of women in the home. They don’t\\nsay a word about the thousands of women who would like to be in the home\\nwho are forced out by the force of industrial conditions to earn their living\\nin the factories, in the work shops, in the stores and in the schools of the\\ncountry.”\\nfore the election a magnificent parade was held in Helena, portraying the\\nhistory of the suffrage cause in this country. The demonstration was\\nplanned and the costumes were designed entirely by Miss Rankin. Hun\\ndreds of men and women from every part of the State came to Helena to\\nparticipate in the parade. And when a comfortable majority was accorded\\nthe suffrage measure at the election a few weeks later Montana women\\nknew that the credit was due largely to the direction of Jeannette Rankin.\\nSTATE LEGISLATURES FOR FEDERAL\\nAMENDMENT\\nSix of eleven of the full suffrage States have petitioned Congress on\\nbehalf of a Federal amendment to the Constitution —Washington, Oregon,\\nKansas, Arizona, Utah, California. North Dakota, which has enjoyed a\\n1917 suffrage awakening, is the first of the coming suffrage States to take\\nsimilar action.\\nWOMEN AS CITY COMMISSIONERS\\nSenator Hughlett has introduced in the Florida Legislature a local bill\\nproviding for the incorporation of the town of Aurantia, in Brevard\\ncounty, with a commission form of government, giving equal suffrage to\\nwomen and providing that the first board of city commissioners should be\\nwomen. This is the first bill of the kind that has ever passed in the Florida\\nLegislature. The first commissioners named are Mrs. Elide J. Wright,\\nMrs. Bessie Wright Pratt, Mrs. Regine von Plinsky, Mrs. Jettie Estelle\\nDraa and Mrs. Jennie Weiss.\\nMARYLAND SUFFRAGE NEWS\\nMention the Maryland Suffrage New* When Patronizing Our Advertisers.\\nCHURCHES ENDORSE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE\\nAMENDMENT\\nTRIBUTES to woman suffrage continue to come from ministerial\\nassociations of equal suffrage States testifying to the uplifting influ\\nence which women bring into political affairs. The 1917 session of the\\nNorth Montana Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church not only\\n“endorsed the principle of equal suffrage as a matter for State-wide con\\nsideration,” but recommended that “it should become embodied in our Na\\ntional Constitution.” The Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho\\nAssociations of Congressional Churches, in session at Colfax, Wash., in\\nMay, declared for nation-wide suffrage in the following resolution:\\n“That in our opinion the enfranchisement of women has been an un\\nqualified blessing in our State, and that we believe that national woman\\nsuffrage will be an advanced step, bringing us nearer the Kingdom of God,\\nfor which we pray.”\\nFrom California comes the endorsement of the ministers of the Evan\\ngelical Lutheran Church.\\nThe Redlands Ministerial Union has unanimously passed a resolution\\nendorsing equal suffrage for women and commending the work of the\\nwomen of California in the support of all constructive legislation looking\\nto the betterment of society.\\nThe resolution reads: “Be it resolved that this Ministerial Association\\nendorse the Woman Suffrage Movement as a reform to be welcomed and\\nencouraged rather than feared, and that we congratulate the women of\\nour own community, as well as of the State of California, for their splen\\ndid and intelligent support of constructive measures looking to the better\\nment of society and especially the amelioration of the lot of women who\\nwork and for the protection and conservation of children.”\\nWOMEN'S MANNER OF DOING THINGS\\n“The session of the Mississippi Valley conference at the Deshler yes\\nterday was itself conclusive proof that the women are ready for suffrage,”\\nis the editorial comment of the Columbus (Ohio) State Journal, concern\\ning the suffrage conference of the Mississippi Valley State, held in that\\ncity May 12-14. “We never saw a meeting conducted so intelligently;\\nnever heard so many bright and sensible speeches; never saw a deliberative\\nbody conduct itself with such good sense and propriety. Why, Congress\\nis a bedlam compared with it. The speeches were to the point, were full of\\nideas and ended at the proper time. Laying aside the splendid cause that\\nbrought these women together, there was enough in their manner of doing\\nthings to show that they were capable of handling public affairs.”\\nWAR CONDUCIVE TO UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE\\n{{XN reference to the constitutional amendment for universal suffrage,\\nJL I need hardly assure you of my favorable attitude toward such\\nlegislation,” says Senator John B. Kendrick in a letter to Dr. Grace\\nHebard, prominent suffragist of Laramie, Wyo. “I think it unlikely that\\nany great amount of general legislation will be attempted during the Spe\\ncial Session, but I shall be greatly surprised if the war situation does not\\nprove helpful in securing favorable action on this amendment. It seems\\nthat any kind of severe crisis is conducive to progress, and for this rea\\nson I think it likely that the reform may be given an impetus.” Senator\\nKendrick was formerly Governor of Wyoming.\\nSUFFRAGE WAR WORK COMMENDED\\nHK. BRYSON, Commissioner of Agriculture for Tennessee, has\\n• expressed his appreciation of the suffragists’ agricultural war\\nservice. In a letter to Mrs. Prudence Simpson Dresser, Chairman for\\nAgriculture of the Middle Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association, Com\\nmissioner Bryson says:\\n“I beg to acknowledge receipt of a letter that you have mailed to 32\\nequal suffrage leagues in 28 counties in Middle Tennessee. The State\\nis to be congratulated on having the aid and assistance of your organiza\\ntion in this campaign for production of food. Please accept my sincere\\nthanks for your assurance of co-operation. Wishing you unbounded\\nsuccess in this great undertaking, I remain.”\",\n",

By a majority of 100,000, Tuesday’s election gave\\nthem unlimited suffrage, and New York State has added 2,000,000 women\\nvoters to their lists.\\nNew York is the first of the great Eastern States to grant women the\\nballot, and having won their fight there, the suffragists of the Empire\\nState now will turn their attention toward a Federal amendment to\\nenfranchise women throughout the United States.\\nMrs. Norman De Whitehouse, chairman of the New York State\\nWomen Suffrage Party, said: “The Party has leased its headquarters\\nfor another year and will join with the National Suffrage Party to fight\\nfor a Federal amendment which will enfranchise all of the women in the\\nUnited States.”\\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the National Suffrage Party,\\npredicted that every women in the country will be given the ballot within\\ntwo more years.\\n“Over the top at last!” said Mrs. Catt. “Now, all we’ve got to do is\\nto roll down the other side to complete victory for the women of the\\nUnited States,” she added.\\nOrganization and intensive work were responsible for the victory,\\nMrs. Catt declared.\\n“We realized in our 1915 campaign,” Mrs. Catt said, “that the educa\\ntion of the people of New York State was not complete. The people had\\ngot their arguments, but they needed two years of reflection for the argu\\nments to sink in. They have not been allowed to forget. Under Mrs.\\nNorman deR. Whitehouse of the State party and Miss Mary Garrett\\nHay of the City party a splendid intensive campaign has been carried on.\\nThere has been no retreat, not for one day.”\\nDr. Anna Howard Shaw said she could scarcely wait to have a huge\\ndiamond added to the 13 others set in the Susan B. Anthony pin she wore\\nat her throat, to represent New York, the fourteenth State to give the\\nfranchise.\\n“New York has taken it out of the unlucky 13 class,” she told the\\nwomen clustered around her, not a few of them with moistened eyes.\\n“And now Til take the midnight train tomorrow for Washington, back\\nto my job as chairman of the Women’s Committee of the Council of\\nNational Defense, with 10 times as much heart for the work.”\\nThe first effort on the part of New York women in behalf of suffrage\\nwas made in 1853 by Susan B. Anthony and a little handful of women\\nwho invaded Albany to urge “women’s rights.” The initial delegation\\nmade but a slight impression on the Legislature, and delegations which\\nfollowed from year to year met with slight encouragement until 1885,\\nwhen the Suffrage Bill got a majority, but not a constitutional majority.\\nSeven years later the suffragists saw a bill through the Legislature\\nwhich gave the women the vote for county school commissioners. It was\\nbut a small slice of the whole loaf, but it increased confidence. Since that\\ntime the suffrage movement has suffered disappointing reverses, but the\\ncause kept gaining influential disciples and growing in momentum until\\nit swept away opposition in Tuesday’s election by a substantial majority.\\nGreater New York put the suffrage amendment over with a heavy\\nmajority. The Boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx gave\\nsuffrage a majority of around 60,000, with many districts unheard from.\\nUp-State countieswhere suffrage was rejected in 1915 reversed their\\nmajority in more than equal proportions, while others, notably Albany,\\nMonroe, Niagara, Orleans, Rensselaer and St. Lawrence, again voted\\nagainst the amendment.\\nThe vote on woman suffrage in New York City complete was: Yes,\\n334,0 ii ; No, 241,315.\\nThe apparent victory of the women was the culmination of an earnest\\nand persistent campaign that had been waged for many years. Defeated\\nin 1915 by a plurality of 195,000, they immediately laid their plans for a\\nrenewal of the battle.\\nTheir program was designed to show feminine fitness for franchise.\\nOne accomplishment was a petition signed by more than a million women\\nof the State asking for the right to vote and was intended as a refuta-\\nMention the Maryland Suffrage News When Patronizing Our Advertisers.\\ntion of the claims of the anti-suffrage workers that only a few New\\nYork women wanted the ballot.\\nOrganization and education featured their campaign. Each of the\\n5772 election districts had its workers and district offices were established\\nin all of the larger cities. Suffrage literature was circulated in carload\\nlots and every voter was reached in some way by the propaganda. Suf\\nfrage orators, both men and women, presented their case at public meet\\nings, factory gatherings, settlement houses and on the street corners.\\nPresident Wilson and Governor Whitman indorsed the movement.\\nThe President recently sent to the suffragists his best wishes for success\\nin New York State, as did a group of Cabinet officers. Virtually all the\\nhigher officers of the nation and the State have made similar announce\\nments. The pickets at the White House gates had brought home to the\\nAdministration leaders as nothing else could, the fact that women wanted\\nthe vote and would not acknowledge defeat, and by their stamina and\\nendurance indicated that a country cannot call itself free which keeps\\none-half its citizens in political bondage.\\nPRESIDENTIAL SUFFRAGE FOR INDIANA\\nWOMEN NOT INVALIDATED\\nTHE right of 770,000 Indiana women to vote for President of the\\nUnited States was not touched by the recent court decision which,\\naccording to the newspapers, declared “the Indiana suffrage law” invalid.\\nThis contention, advanced by the National American Woman Suffrage\\nAssociation from the moment the news was received, was confirmed on\\nNovember 5 by a telegram from the president of the Indiana branch of\\nthe association, Mrs. R. E. Edwards of Peru, Ind., who wires as follows:\\n“Presidential suffrage not put to test and not mentioned in decision.” The\\ncourt decision dealt only with the municipal and partial State suffrage that\\nhad been granted to the women of Indiana.\\nThe power of State Legislatures to designate the electors of President\\nof the United States is specified in the Federal Constitution. Therefore\\nit is by inference only that the entire Indiana suffrage act can be considered\\nunconstitutional, and such an inference must rest upon the hypothesis that\\nit was not the intention of the Legislature to grant Presidential suffrage\\nif municipal and State suffrage should be adjudged impossible under the\\nState Constitution.\\nAccording to Mrs. Edwards, there may be a rehearing of the Marion\\ncounty case, in which the recent decision was made, and at that rehearing\\nall mooted points will be settled. Mrs. Edwards also wires the National\\nSuffrage Association that the decision was a great suprise and that public\\nopinion as reflected by the press is strongly against it.\\nTen suffragists who have served sixty days in the workhouse and jail\\non the technical charge of “obstructing traffic” because they reminded the\\nPresident and the public that democracy begins at home, were released\\nSaturday, November 3. Miss Lucy Burns of Brooklyn; Miss Mary Win\\nsor of Haverford, Pa.; Miss Lucy Branham of Baltimore, Md.; Mrs\\nPauline Adams of Norfolk, Va.; Miss Dorothy Bartlett of Putnam,\\nConn.; Miss Edith Ainge and Miss Margaret Fotheringham of Buffalo;\\nMiss Maud Malone of New York; Mrs. Annie Arniel of Wilmington,\\nDel., and Miss Eleanor Calnan of Methuen, Mass., have served the longest\\nsentence ever served by suffragists for the sake of their cause. Even in\\nthe days of militancy in England the longest sentence was thirty days.\\nThese ten suffragists were welcomed home at a Sunday-night supper at\\nthe Woman’s Party headquarters. Mrs. W. Thompson Burch, District of\\nColumbia chairman of the Woman’s Party, was in charge of the arrange\\nments. Mrs. John Brannan of New York presided.\\nVOLUNTEERS WANTED\\nTo do addressing and other important clerical work at Just\\nGovernment League Headquarters, 817 North Charles street.\\nPlease send in your name and the amount of time you can spare to\\nMiss E.

It is vain to hold\\npeople responsible for conditions Which they cannot control, but it is\\nequally vain to relieve people of the approbrium which attaches to the\\nevil use of power. At the present time the Democratic Party is all\\npowerful in our Federal Government. The Federal House Rules Com\\nmittee has reported against the creation of a standing committee of the\\nHouse on Woman Suffrage. It is still possible to carry the fight to\\nthe floor of the House and create the Committee if the Democrats so\\ndesire; it is practically impossible to do so otherwise. The Democrats\\nhold the key to the situation; therefore, since they have the power they\\nmust bear the responsibility also.\\nThe National policy of the various National Suffrage Associations\\nmay well be looked into at the present juncture. In the past it has been\\nconsidered the part of wisdom for the suffragists to keep clear of party\\nlines. This is doubtless because until recently the progress of the suf\\nfrage movement in the United States has been dependent upon State\\nrather than Federal action. It is well known that the minority party in\\nany state has ever been readier than the majority party to espouse new\\nreforms. Thus in Connecticut and Massachusetts the Democratic Party\\nhas a Woman Suffrage plank in its platform, while in Maryland the Re\\npublican Party has taken up this reform.\\nFor the National associations to have advocated io years ago a con\\n■certed attack upon any National party would have been simply to con\\nfuse the situation in the states where at that time the fight was centered.\\nThe situation today is wholly different. A sufficient number of women\\nvote now to make it possible to force all the National political parties\\nto espouse the cause, if only the women voters can be persuaded to line\\nup unitedly against the party which can, but will not, enfranchise women.\\nAll the candidates for office in the suffrage states are of course in\\nfavor of suffrage, so if the old National policy of opposing simply the\\ncandidates who do not believe in suffrage is followed, the influence of\\nthe women voters in regard to the National political platforms will he\\nsimply thrown away.\\nThe candidates in the non-suffrage states must be brought to realize\\nthat they are hurting their party in the suffrage states by failing to work\\nfor Nation-wide Woman Suffrage, before we can hope for favorable\\nFederal action, for the kind of power that the enfranchised women have\\nis the only kind of power that the politicians really fear.\\nIf the suffragists themselves are really non-partisan, and put their\\nlove of the cause before the love of their party, it will not be difficult in\\nHELP THE CAUSE. —Mention the Maryland Suffrage News When Patronizing Our Advertisers.\\nMARYLAND SUFFRAGE NEWS\\n1916 to force both the Democratic and the Republican parties to pledge\\nthemselves in State and Nation to support Equal Suffrage. It is useless\\nto expect the National parties to indorse Woman Suffrage if the suf\\nfragists cannot make up their minds to oppose any party that fails to\\nincorporate a Woman Suffrage plank in its platform, for politicians are\\nnot philanthropists, and they realize full well that the insertion of a\\nWoman Suffrage plank in their platforms would mean the concerted\\nopposition of the vicious interests.\\nIn matters of great moment our National Government is controlled\\nalmost wholly by party action, and for that very reason the suffragists\\nmust make their fight along party lines if they are to win.\\nTHE GOVERNOR’S WISDOM\\nGovernor Goldsborough’s refusal to grant a pardon to Claude Ston\\ncipher, who is serving a two-year’s sentence in the House of Correction\\nfor carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of consent, deserves un\\nqualified approval.\\nThe plea was made that Dr. Stoncipher could not receive adequate\\nmedical aid in the House of Correction, and as he is suffering from\\nBright’s Disease, it was surmised that this appeal would result in his\\n.speedy release. The Governor, however, refused to be hood-winked.\\nFie instituted an investigation of the hospital facilities at the House of\\nCorrection, found them to be adequate, and wisely determined to use\\nhis power to uphold the law of the State.\\nEvery man and woman in Maryland owes a debt of gratitude to the\\nGovernor for his determination to protect the daughters of the State.\\nCONGRESSIONAL UNION\\nThe Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage is a society organized\\nto obtain a United States Constitutional Amendment, enfranchising\\nwomen. j . : ! R %\\nIt is entirely non-partisan; it looks to the party in power, whether\\nit be Republican, Democratic, or Progressive, to pass an amendment\\ngiving the women of this country the freedom they have a right to\\nclaim.\\nAt the present time, the Democratic Party possesses immense power;\\nit controls all three branches of Government; it has the opportunity\\nand the strength to pass a Woman Suffrage Amendment through Cong\\nress at the present session. It is, therefore, responsible to the women\\nof the country for whatever action it takes or refuses to take.\\nThere is every reason why the Democratic Party should put the force\\nof the Administration behind the Suffrage Amendment. There is a\\nstrong sentiment for suffrage in Congress, especially in the Upper\\nHouse. Democrats cannot ignore suffrage without ignoring the funda\\nmental principles of their party. Moreover, it is impossible for a\\nnational party to deny or refuse to consider the question of women’s\\npolitical rights while appealing in national election for the support of\\nnearly four million voters.\\nIf, however, the Democratic Party fails to take advantage of the\\ngreat opportunity before it, the women of the country will hold them\\nresponsible at the polls and will make use of every effort to defeat the\\nDemocratic candidates in all the doubtful constituencies.\\nAs between parties this policy is entirely impartial. If the Re\\npublicans were in power, they would be regarded as responsible for\\nwhatever they did or failed to do for the Suffrage Amendment and\\ntheir candidates would be regarded for good or evil as the representa\\ntives of their party and not as individuals. The Democrats happen to\\nbe in power; the responsibility therefore is theirs.\\nIn pursuing this policy, the Congressional Union recognizes that we\\nlive under a Party Government; that the Majority Party, not the in\\ndividual members of all parties, is the potent factor in national politics;\\nand that we must seek enfranchisement from the man or group of men\\nhaving the power to grant it. President Wilson himself frankly stated\\nto the deputation sent from the Convention of the National American\\nWoman Suffrage Association, that he would not “start anything” which\\nhad not come under the “organic consideration” of this party. In so\\nsaying, he put the question where it belongs, squarely up to the Demo\\ncrats.\\nRUSSIA TO HAVE WOMEN INSPECTORS\\nFOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES\\nIn Russia, a motion for the appointment of women as inspectors of\\nfactories was recently introduced in the Duma, and it was decided by\\na vote of 77 to 64 to draft a bill to this effect. It is asserted on official\\nauthority that the Government intends to take up the question of women\\ninspectors for certain industries.\\n[January 24, 1914.]',\n",

       "   'ocr_eng': 'MARYLAND SUFFRAGE NEWS\\nTHE TWO SUFFRAGE AMENDMENTS IN CONGRESS\\nBy Lucy Burns, Vice-Chairman of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage.\\nIN the Sixty-Third Congress two Federal amendments for woman suf\\nfrage were submitted. The first amendment, which was drafted by\\nSusan B. Anthony in 1875, and has been before Congress since that date,\\nproposes the national enfianchisement of women by Federal amendment.\\nThe second amendment, which was introduced in the last Congress by\\nSenator Shafroth of Colorado and Mr. Mitchell Palmer of Pennsylvania,\\nproposes the establishment of the initiative and referendum in all of the\\nStates of the Union for the disposition of the question of woman suffrage\\nonly.\\nAll suffragists agree that the original amendment, framed and worked\\nfor by the founders of the suffrage movement in America, is far superior\\nto the second amendment. It aims to secure our final aim—the enfran\\nchisement of women throughout the United States. The second amend\\nment merely aims to secure by Federal amendment another method of\\nwinning suffrage in the States.\\nThe national suffrage movement is now so active and hopeful that it\\nbecomes necessary for every suffragist in the country to decide which of\\nthese amendments will receive her support.\\nAdvocates of the Shafroth-Palmer amendment declare that while the\\nSusan B. Anthony amendment is infinitely superior to their substitutes, it\\ncannot be passed at all in the near future. The Shafroth amendment can\\nbe passed, they say. If passed, it will accelerate suffrage activity in the\\nStates and help to secure State victories; with the aid of these we can then\\nturn around and enact the older and better amendment into law.\\nThe Susan B. Anthony amendment, however, can be passed, and passed\\nsoon.. There aie now in this country nearly 4,000,000 women who have\\nthe right to vote for President of the United States. A Presidential elec\\ntion is pending. Suffrage organizations are established in every State in\\nthe Union, many of them active and powerful. If a united demand from\\nthe suffragists of the East and the women voters of the West is made upon\\nCongress for favorable action on the woman suffrage amendment, such a\\ndemand would be irresistible. It is obviously to the advantage of any na\\ntional party, with a national election at hand, to consent to the reference of\\nthe Federal suffrage amendment to the State legislatures rather than bear\\nthe unenviable responsibility of blocking its progress.\\nThere is very little likelihood, as far as suffrage support is concerned,\\nof enacting the Shafroth-Palmer amendment into law. Most women have\\nvery little interest in amending the Constitution so as to secure in their\\nStates the opportunity for a suffrage referendum, when they can get the\\nsame opportunity by the vote of their own State Legislature. It is some\\ntimes difficult to induce a State Legislature to take action on suffrage, but\\nSIDE LIGHTS ON THE CONVENTION\\nBy L. W. Neilson Ford.\\nT F all our dealings with the press could be with people like Miss Cop\\npinger, we would not take the defensive attitude she advised against.\\nMiss Coppinger could not see herself while she spoke, so she does not\\nknow how attractive she was in a room already filled with a far finer look\\ning group of women than one usually sees.\\nOne of the good stories that could not be heard by all the subscribers\\nto the Maryland Suffrage News was told at the convention by Mrs.\\nRobert Moss of Annapolis. A man passed by the Just Government\\nLeague headquarters calling strawberries, and Mrs. Moss, who was speak\\ning, said that it reminded her of her first suffrage parade, when she was\\nstruggling with the big banner of the Anne Arundel League, hurrying to\\nget to the graduation of her son who was to receive his degree in law.\\nJust as she was about to turn a corner a man, on seeing the Anne Arundel\\nbanner, called out to her from the pavement nearby, “Anaranel straw\\nberries ! strawberries!” His one idea of Anne Arundel was strawberries!\\nThe good photographer friend we have must have been pleased at the\\nMention the Maryland Suffrage News When Patronizing Our Advertisers.\\nit would be still more awful to contemplate amending the entire Constitu\\ntion of the United States before securing the opportunity for a suffrage\\n, referendum in one’s own State.\\nAdvocates of the Shafroth-Palmer amendment declare, however, that\\ntheir measure can command more support among Congressmen. There is\\n, a strong States’ rights party in the National Legislature, we are told. The\\n: weaker amendment will secure all the votes that the Susan B. Anthony\\namendment would get and will also secure some votes from Congressmen\\nwho believe in States rights. It is perfectly plain, therefore, they say,\\nthat the Shafroth-Palmer amendment has a better chance of passing than\\nthe Susan B. Anthony amendment, and should be worked for.\\nThis argument would be very true, indeed, if Congressmen had nothing\\nto consider but their own personal views on woman suffrage; but they\\nhave much more to consider. They have to bear in mind the wishes of the\\nsuffi agists in their constituencies, the wishes of the anti-suffragists and the\\nwishes of their own party leaders. Their problem is to please as many\\npeople as possible. If they can appear to support woman suffrage without\\npassing it, they are politically in an impregnable position.\\nThe introduction of two amendments gives them just such an opportu\\nnity. They can arrange to support, some one amendment, and some the\\nother. I hey will then all claim to be regarded as equally good suffragists,\\nand yet neither proposition will be able to secure the necessary amount of\\nsupport. This is so old and well known a device that when Congressmen\\nare anxious to avoid action on a measure which commands warm support\\nand bitter opposition among the public, they usually propose a substitute\\nmeasure themselves and endeavor to divide up votes between two propo\\nsitions. When suffragists introduce a compromise measure they play into\\nthe hands of their opponents.\\nIt is, moreover, an unwise, because indirect, policy to work for one\\namendment to the United States Constitution, in the hope of being ulti\\nmately able to secure another amendment to the United States Constitu\\ntion. If it were absolutely necessary, suffragists would take up even this\\nburden. But it is not necessary. Sufficient strength throughout the coun\\ntry already exists for direct work for national woman suffrage. The sub\\nstantial character of the vote secured on the Susan B. Anthony amend\\nment in the Senate and House during the last Congress, in the face of\\ndetermined opposition from the leaders of the majority party, sufficiently\\nproves this. It is a grave mistake, at this stage in the history of our move\\nment, to complicate the whole Federal situation and play into the hands of\\nprofessional politicians by introducing into Congress a compromise\\nmeasure.\\nfine looking group of women she snapped her camera at when they stood\\non the Just Government League steps on the first day of the convention.\\nThe unity of interest shown at the annual convention would give the\\nlie to what our enemies say about women arguing.\\nThe reason the flashlight would not take a picture at the suffrage\\ndinner is because a flash in the pan,” so to speak, is not a suffrage\\nmethod.. Suffrage methods are so open and above board that it takes the\\nsteady light of day to take picture of suffragists.\\nWe who are born in Maryland always expect the best things to come\\nfrom our counties. We have an English way of speaking of families, as\\nbelonging to Harford, St. Mary’s, Montgomery, etc., etc. We say, “Oh,\\nthe Joneses! You say they are from Prince George’s? We haven’t that\\nname down there; that belongs to Anne Arundel, etc.” And our counties\\nmade good at the convention. Each group represented strength and pur\\npose, showed the very best type of women, and we have good cause to know\\nthat with all the counties allied for suffrage, we can “get it across.”\\n27',\n",
