    "**Main exercise: counting character lines and sorting them:**\n",
    "* We can use a dictionary to keep counts of how many times a character speaks. To do so:\n",
    "  * Instantiate an empty dictionary where we will store counts of character lines.\n",
    "  * Assuming we already know the list of characters (provided above), we can iterate over the list of characters.\n",
    "  * Then, for each character, we iterate over the lines in the file.\n",
    "  * If the line starts with the name of the character, there are two possibilities:\n",
    "  * 1: if the character is not in the dictionary, we will add it to the dictionary, with value 1 (because we've seen it once)\n",
    "  * 2: if the character is already in the dictionary, we will not add it to the dictionary (because it's already there!) but we will increase the value by 1.\n",
    "* After having iterated over all characters, we already have a dictionary of counts per character. We can now sort this dictionary (using the `sorted()` function), and print the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra exercise: finding the characters in the play:**\n",
    "* Instantiate an empty list where we will keep the list of characters.\n",
    "* You can iterate over the list of lines in the Hamlet txt file.\n",
    "* Notice the pattern: character names happen at the beginning of the line, in capital letters, followed by a dot. Create a regular expression that captures the character name. Therefore, if a line starts this way, add the captured character name to the list of characters. Watch out: the word \"SCENE\" has the same pattern, you may want to write a condition that ignores \"SCENE\" and does not add it to the list of characters."
