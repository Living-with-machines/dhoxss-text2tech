      "The effect of the Bill's handling on doctors is shown by a letter I received a few days ago from two eminent Yorkshire consultants, Mr. G. A. Craig, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist for the Bradford A group of hospitals, and Mr. John Mander, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at York, which reads: The following statement has been submitted to the 29 Consultant Gynaecologists employed by the Leeds Regional Hospital Board (as per attached list). There follows a list of distinguished medical men and women.\n",
      "          \n",
      "I will not anticipate arguments which I shall address to the House later, but it will emerge in the course of debate during the night that this is not a Bill which will permit a large increase in therapeutic abortion in the National Health Service hospitals. The Minister knows that well. There are about 10,000 gynaecological beds in the country and there are 60,000 women on the gynaecological waiting list, awaiting appointments. The chances of the National Health Service providing massive facilities for abortions once the Bill becomes law are remote. The Minister knows that. The Bill is therefore a licence to permit abortion on a very much larger scale in the private sector. Thanks to the abdication of responsibility by the Minister and the blindness of the sponsors, the Bill will do little to ensure any change in the number of therapeutic abortions carried out in the National Health Service, but it will give a great deal of encouragement to the professional abortionists in the private sector.\n",
      "        \n",
      "Apart from questions of psychosis, there is the further and perhaps most important sub-division under the issue of mental indications for an abortion, the risk of suicide. Again the lay point of view would very often be that the risk of this taking place is so great that there must be a termination. But, looked at from the medical point of view, a principle which the Amendment seeks to write into the Bill, there may be a completely different answer. I again quote from the researches of Dr. Sim: In the City of Birmingham with a population of a million and a quarter over a six-year period 120 women of child bearing age committed suicide. Not one was pregnant. Post mortem examinations have been carried out, so there was no question of a pregnancy or even abortion being missed. I followed this up with a second six-year inquiry and this time one woman who was pregnant had committed suicide. She was a married woman with two or three children, attending a psychiatric clinic at the time. She needed psychiatric treatment. So in a 12-year period in Birmingham we have one suicide amongst pregnant women and here abortion would not have influenced the outcome. Dr. Sim goes on to go into details, with which I will not burden the House.[HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear.\"] This is very important, because these are the details of research, which give some substance to what is otherwise an extraordinarily vague conception.\n",
      "          \n",
      " If such knowledge exists, why has it been suppressed from the public at large? He makes it clear that the reason is that doctors' knowledge about what abortion involves is often painful and upsetting to the women concerned.\n",
      "          \n",
      "It is true to say that many women suffer serious consequences from having an abortion, not on health grounds but simply because she did not want a child. It can cause her the gravest mental anguish for having brought about the death of her own child. Recently, I received a letter from a woman who said that when she was 18, her father had threatened to throw her out of the house unless she had an abortion. She was taken to a psychiatrist and had to pretend to be suicidal. She had an abortion. After the operation, she really felt suicidal, and she said in her moving letter to me that she has never got over the frightful feeling of loss. She became sterile, and has since had two nervous breakdowns. It is not an uncommon story.\n",
      "          \n",
      "Certainly we must take steps to see that women at risk are not placed in jeopardy. Later we can go into the question of abnormality in children, a terrifyingly difficult problem, but while we are discussing the question of environment, the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) must accept that the Bill is still not right. After all, this is the seventh or eighth time that this provision has been re-written. Is it right now? Perhaps the ninth try will be better. Or perhaps the seventh, or second, attempt was the right answer.\n",
      "          \n",
      "The Chief of the Bureau is assisted by two part-time psychiatrists, and there are four persons, generally gynaecologists, who take it in turns to act as chairman of the committee. In addition, other people are involved who are women experienced in social welfare, and they take turns at being the third member of the committee. There is a similar provision in more general terms in my Amendment providing for social workers to be members of the panel.\n",
      "          \n",
      "What we want to achieve under the Bill is that a person who can genuinely justify that a baby should be aborted will not be in an atmosphere when she will be frightened to take steps to terminate the pregnancy. What would inevitably happen as a result of having a panel of experts would be that the simpler type of person might be inhibited from going before a panel, which would be rather frightening. Because the panel would be frightening, that type of person would be much more inclined to continue to go to a back-street abortionist. Therefore, many women who even my hon. Friend would be prepared to accept probably should be aborted would not be aborted. There is a good deal of danger in my hon. Friend's proposition.\n",
      "          \n",
      "The rejection of the Amendment which would have provided that there should be expert guidance on whether an abortion should be carried out makes Amendment No. 40 all the more important, because we should not undertake decisions of this kind without going into them very carefully. The experts referred to in Amendment No. 40 are doctors, psychiatrists and social workers. This is an important point to recognise. They would be persons well versed in the facilities available to help women in difficulties with their pregnancies. A panel of this sort might have to deal with all kinds of difficulties. The difficulty might be one of housing. A social worker on the panel would surely be able to say whether or not the difficulty facing the woman could be resolved by means available. There are plenty of remedies at the disposal of local authorities, which is very relevant when we are dealing with such a very important matter as abortion.\n",
      "          \n",
      "The difficulty in which the woman finds herself may well be that she already has an ample quiverful. If so, and if the extra work entailed in having an extra child is too much for her, a social worker would surely be able to bring in the home help service, which is there to help women in such situations. If the difficulty is financial, there are plenty of ways in which the financial difficulties of a woman who is pregnant can be resolved. If it is suggested that she may have a handicapped child, as Clause 1(1, b ) visualises, the difficulty may be able to be resolved within the scope of existing facilities.\n",
      "          \n",
      "On recent occasions doctors have told me that women are coming into the surgeries, at this moment, and saying that it is the law that abortion can now be obtained. They think the Bill has been passed through Parliament. Doctors are already receiving far too many inquiries from patients for abortions to take place. If we had a panel of experts the doctors would be in a much better position.\n",
      "        \n",
      "In cases where women are going to a doctor for an abortion, it would be much better if the doctor could explain to them that there is to be set up a panel of experts who could go into the facts of the case. The doctor might not be able to know all the details.\n",
      "        \n",
      "This, I think, is a further illustration of the wrongheadedness of those, both the sponsors of the Bill and the Minister himself, who have rejected the considered view of the British Medical Association and of the Royal College of Physicians and Gynaecologists that one of the two registered medical practitioners should have special experience and qualifications. My hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) thought that the value of having this particular panel was that it would provide expert advice for women seeking an abortion. But this is not the case. The proposal is that there shall be a panel to whom the doctor in the case can refer.\n",
      "          \n",
      "I can lead the hon. Member to water but I cannot make him drink. I have carefully explained that what we do here must bear some relation to the realities outside the House. We can enact an Act of Parliament here, but it would be meaningless if we have not got the support of the doctors. We shall raise the expectations of women all over the country that there will be more therapeutic abortions. But in fact, in the present mood of the medical profession, there will be precious few, for the reasons which I have given. The proposal to have a panel to which the two doctors will go—or one of them will go—for advice is. in the view of the B.M.A., alien to our tradition of inter-professional relationships in this country. With great reluctance, therefore. I cannot support the Amendments and advise the House not to do so.\n",
